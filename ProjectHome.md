## Why This Project is Very Important ##
  * Recently CBSE has changed its syllabus. Syllabus contains Java/MySQL. ( http://code.google.com/p/cbse-065/downloads/list ). Thus the students are getting their first exposure to the FLOSS environment in their syllabus and textbook. But textbooks are not ready. We fear that even if the textbook is published by some well known author (Ex Sunita Arora), it will be containing Windows based examples and development tools. For example those textbook won't provide examples of installation of FLOSS software on FLOSS platforms like MySQL on Ubuntu or Eclipse and Java on Debian. So it is The FOSS community of India's responsibility to address these issues and give the best textbook to our young children.
