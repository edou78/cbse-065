Here you will learn how to install,configure open source platform,programming tools.

==Operating System : Linux==
===Introduction===
The name "Linux" comes from the Linux kernel, originally written in 1991 by Linus Torvalds. The full operating system usually comprises components such as utilities and libraries from the GNU Project, the X Window System, the GNOME and KDE desktop environments and commonly-used applications like firefox,openoffice.

===Choosing from the pool of linux Distributions===
Linux distributions have taken linux into wide variety of forms â€” from fully featured desktop and server operating systems to minimal environments (typically for use in embedded systems, or for booting from a floppy disk). A distribution is most simply described as a particular set of applications,kernel modules installed on top of the linux kernel, such that its "out-of-the-box" capabilities meet most of the needs of its particular end-user base.

===Installation===
There are many ways to install a Linux distribution. The most common method of installing Linux is by booting from a CD-ROM or DVD that contains the installation program and installable software. Such a CD can be burned from a downloaded ISO image, purchased alone for a low price, provided as a cover disk with a magazine, shipped for free by request, or obtained as part of a box set that may also include manuals and additional commercial software. New users tend to begin by partitioning a hard drive in order to keep their previously-installed operating system. The Linux distribution can then be installed on its own separate partition without affecting previously saved data.
