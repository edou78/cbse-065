= Introduction =

Standard utilities available on a GNU/Linux OS


= Details =

This module provides an introduction to the standard utilities available on a GNU/Linux OS installation. We shall cover the features of each utility and the command line syntax for doing typical administrative tasks.

We shall be using debian distribution named Lenny. However what we learn here will be applicable on almost any GNU/Linux distribution like Fedora, Suse, Mandriva, Ubuntu, Slacware etc. Embedded distributions like DSL, MontaVista, Emdebian etc, may not have all the utilities and even included utilities will have several features missing. 

Utilities are small command line programs used to do mundane installation, maintenance, configuration and testing tasks.
These programs can be divided into a few broad categories
 #1 Shell
 #2 File, Shell and Text utils
 #3 Disk utils
 #4 Network utils
 #5 Search utils
 #6 Install utils
 #7 Editors
 #8 Others

Before we proceed any further we will take a look at that most profound creation of all - man. No it is not man from hu-man or wo-man, but man from manual and will beat super-man. It is your mana from heaven and will save you from disaster always. Well at least from disaster on the computer, where quite often even superman like powers fail.
man is a shortform for manual and gives you a brief description of the programme and it's usage syntax for the innumerable options available with every utility.
The syntax for man is man `<command>`
Thus typing 
man man 
will, in a bout of self glorification, tell you all about itself and give you the details of what the man command does and it's usage options. Although man itself has several options just typing man `<command>` is sufficient for most purposes.

So before you go and type rm and wipe your disk clean, please type man rm to understand the implications of your action. Well even if you are not going to wipe your disk clean do use man - especially when this textbook gets boring.

The usage syntax for every utility listed below is available with man. Infact this module is a printed version of each utility's manpage with occasional changes.

==  Fileutils, shellutils and textutils ==

These utilities are available in the coreutils package in Debain  / Redhat and their derivatives.  Previously a set of three packages,  GNU fileutils, shellutils and textutils, implemented the core set of GNU utilities.

on apt based distributions like debian, Ubuntu, Knoppix etc 
apt-get install coreutils 
will install coreutils

On rpm based distros like Redhat, Fedora, etc
rpm -i coreutils
will install coreutils

And by the way, you just learn't how to install a package on debian and derivative distros and Redhat and derivative distros in the above two paras.
 
In the previous section on shells, you have seen how output from one command is piped to a second (or third or more) command. We can pipe the output of a utility to another one to ease tasks or realise more complex tasks.
For example ls gives you a long list if you have many files and the output scrolls off the top of your screen. So you use ls | less which will give you a scrollable output.
Or ls -al | grep ^d which will only list directories.

For complex repetitive tasks one can write a bash script.

=== basename ===
Strip directory and suffix from filenames
Examples

 basename /usr/bin/sort
              Output "sort".

 basename include/stdio.h .h
              Output "stdio".

=== cat ===
Concatenate FILE(s), or standard input, to standard output.

       -A, --show-all
              equivalent to -vET

       -b, --number-nonblank
              number nonempty output lines

       -e     equivalent to -vE

       -E, --show-ends
              display $ at end of each line

       -n, --number
              number all output lines

       -s, --squeeze-blank
              suppress repeated empty output lines

       -t     equivalent to -vT

       -T, --show-tabs
             display TAB characters as ^I

       -u     (ignored)

       -v, --show-nonprinting
              use ^ and M- notation, except for LFD and TAB

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.

EXAMPLES

 cat /usr/share/doc/manpages/README.Debian 

 will give you details of the debian GNU/Linux manual pages

=== chgrp === 
Change  the group of each FILE to GROUP.  With --reference, change the group of each FILE to that of RFILE.
       -c, --changes
              like verbose but report only when a change is made

       --dereference
              affect the referent of each symbolic link (this is the default),  rather  than  the  symbolic link itself

       -h, --no-dereference
              affect  each  symbolic  link  instead of any referenced file (useful only on systems that can change the ownership of a symlink)

       --no-preserve-root
              do not treat / specially (the default)

       --preserve-root
              fail to operate recursively on /

       -f, --silent, --quiet
              suppress most error messages

       --reference=RFILE
              use RFILE's group rather than specifying a GROUP value

       -R, --recursive
              operate on files and directories recursively

       -v, --verbose
              output a diagnostic for every file processed

       The following options modify how a hierarchy is traversed when the -R option is also specified. If more than one is specified, only the final one takes effect.

       -H     if a command line argument is a symbolic link to a directory, traverse it

       -L     traverse every symbolic link to a directory encountered

       -P     do not traverse any symbolic links (default)

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

EXAMPLES
       chgrp staff /u
              Change the group of /u to "staff".

       chgrp -hR staff /u
              Change the group of /u and subfiles to "staff".

=== chmod ===

This manual page documents the GNU version of chmod.  chmod changes the file mode bits of each given file according to mode, which can be either a symbolic representation of  changes to make, or an octal number representing the bit pattern for the new mode bits.

The  format  of a symbolic mode is [ugoa...][[+-=][perms...]...], where perms is either zero or more letters from the set rwxXst, or a single letter from the set ugo.  Multiple symbolic  modes  can  be given, separated by commas.

A combination of the letters ugoa controls which users' access to the file will be changed: the user who owns it (u), other users in the file's group (g), other users not in the file's  group  (o),  or all  users (a).  If none of these are given, the effect is as if a were given, but bits that are set in the umask are not affected.

The operator + causes the selected file mode bits to be added to the existing file mode bits of each file;  -  causes them to be removed; and = causes them to be added and causes unmentioned bits to be removed except that a directory's unmentioned set user and group ID bits are not affected.

The letters rwxXst select file mode bits for the affected users: read (r), write  (w),  execute  (or search for directories) (x), execute/search only if the file is a directory or already has execute permission for some user (X), set user or group ID on execution (s), restricted deletion flag or sticky bit (t).  Instead of one or more of these letters, you can specify exactly one of the letters ugo: the permissions granted to the user who owns the file (u), the  permissions  granted  to  other users who are members of the file's group (g), and the permissions granted to users that are in neither of the two preceding categories (o).

A numeric mode is from one to four octal digits (0-7), derived by adding up the bits with values  4, 2,  and 1.  Omitted digits are assumed to be leading zeros.  The first digit selects the set user ID (4) and set group ID (2) and restricted deletion or sticky (1) attributes.  The second digit selects permissions  for the user who owns the file: read (4), write (2), and execute (1); the third selects permissions for other users in the file's group, with the same values;  and  the  fourth  for  other users not in the file's group, with the same values.

chmod  never  changes  the  permissions of symbolic links; the chmod system call cannot change their permissions. This is not a problem since the permissions of symbolic links are never used. However, for each symbolic link listed on the command line, chmod changes the permissions of the pointed-to file. In contrast, chmod ignores symbolic links encountered during  recursive  directory traversals.

*SETUID AND SETGID BITS*
       chmod clears the set-group-ID bit of a regular file if the file's group ID does not match the user's effective group ID or one of the user's supplementary group IDs, unless the user has appropriate privileges. Additional restrictions may cause the set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits of MODE or RFILE to be ignored.  This behavior depends on the policy and functionality of the underlying  chmod system call.  When in doubt, check the underlying system behavior. 
       chmod preserves a directory's set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits unless you explicitly specify otherwise. You can set or clear the bits with symbolic modes like u+s and g-s, and you can set (but  not clear) the bits with a numeric mode.

*RESTRICTED DELETION FLAG OR STICKY BIT*
       The restricted deletion flag or sticky bit is a single bit, whose interpretation depends on the file
       type.  For directories, it prevents unprivileged users from removing  or  renaming  a  file  in  the
       directory unless they own the file or the directory; this is called the restricted deletion flag for
       the directory, and is commonly found on world-writable directories like /tmp.  For regular files  on
       some  older  systems, the bit saves the program's text image on the swap device so it will load more
       quickly when run; this is called the sticky bit.

OPTIONS
       Change the mode of each FILE to MODE.

       -c, --changes
              like verbose but report only when a change is made

       --no-preserve-root
              do not treat / specially (the default)

       --preserve-root
              fail to operate recursively on /

       -f, --silent, --quiet
       -v, --verbose
              output a diagnostic for every file processed

       --reference=RFILE
              use RFILE's mode instead of MODE values

       -R, --recursive
              change files and directories recursively

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       Each MODE is of the form `[ugoa]*([-+=]([rwxXst]*|[ugo]))+`.

=== chown ===
This  manual page documents the GNU version of chown.  chown changes the user and/or group ownership of each given file. If only an owner (a user name or numeric user ID) is given, that user is made the  owner of each given file, and the files' group is not changed.  If the owner is followed by a colon and a group name (or numeric group ID), with no spaces between them, the  group ownership of the files is changed as well. If a colon but no group name follows the user name, that user is made the owner of the files and the group of the files is changed to that user's login group. If the colon and group are given, but the owner is omitted, only the group of the files is changed; in this   case, chown performs the same function as chgrp.  If only a colon is given, or if the entire operand is empty, neither the owner nor the group is changed.

OPTIONS
       Change  the  owner  and/or  group  of each FILE to OWNER and/or GROUP.  With --reference, change the
       owner and group of each FILE to those of RFILE.

       -c, --changes
              like verbose but report only when a change is made

       --dereference
              affect the referent of each symbolic link (this is the default),  rather  than  the  symbolic
              link itself

       -h, --no-dereference
              affect  each  symbolic  link  instead of any referenced file (useful only on systems that can
              change the ownership of a symlink)

       --from=CURRENT_OWNER:CURRENT_GROUP
              change the owner and/or group of each file only if its current owner and/or group match those
              specified here.  Either may be omitted, in which case a match is not required for the omitted
              attribute.

       --no-preserve-root
              do not treat / specially (the default)

       --preserve-root
              fail to operate recursively on /

       -f, --silent, --quiet
              suppress most error messages

       --reference=RFILE
              use RFILE's owner and group rather than specifying OWNER:GROUP values

       -R, --recursive
              operate on files and directories recursively

       -v, --verbose
              output a diagnostic for every file processed

       The following options modify how a hierarchy is traversed when the -R option is also specified.   If
       more than one is specified, only the final one takes effect.

       -H     if a command line argument is a symbolic link to a directory, traverse it

       -L     traverse every symbolic link to a directory encountered

       -P     do not traverse any symbolic links (default)

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       Owner is unchanged if missing.  Group is unchanged if missing, but changed to login group if implied by a : following a symbolic OWNER.  OWNER and GROUP may be numeric as well as symbolic.

EXAMPLES
       chown root /u
              Change the owner of /u to "root".

       chown root:staff /u
              Likewise, but also change its group to "staff".

       chown -hR root /u
              Change the owner of /u and subfiles to "root".


=== chroot ===
       Run COMMAND with root directory set to NEWROOT.

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       If no command is given, run `${SHELL} -i` (default: /bin/sh).

=== cksum ===
      Print CRC checksum and byte counts of each FILE.

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit
EXAMPLES
       cksum /bin/ls
       3265941495 92312 /bin/ls
       displays the crc checksum 3265941495 and byte count 92312 of /bin/ls
   
=== comm ===
       Compare sorted files FILE1 and FILE2 line by line.

       With no options, produce three-column output.  Column one contains lines unique to FILE1, column two
       contains lines unique to FILE2, and column three contains lines common to both files.

       -1     suppress lines unique to FILE1

       -2     suppress lines unique to FILE2

       -3     suppress lines that appear in both files

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
        output version information and exit

              same as -dpR

       --backup[=CONTROL]
              make a backup of each existing destination file

       -b     like --backup but does not accept an argument

       --copy-contents
              copy contents of special files when recursive

       -d     same as --no-dereference --preserve=links

       -f, --force
              if an existing destination file cannot be opened, remove it and try again

       -i, --interactive
              prompt before overwrite

       -H     follow command-line symbolic links in SOURCE

       -l, --link
              link files instead of copying

       -L, --dereference
              always follow symbolic links in SOURCE

       -P, --no-dereference
              never follow symbolic links in SOURCE

       -p     same as --preserve=mode,ownership,timestamps

       --preserve[=ATTR_LIST]
              preserve  the  specified  attributes  (default: mode,ownership,timestamps), if possible additional attributes: context, links, all

       --no-preserve=ATTR_LIST
              don't preserve the specified attributes

       --parents
              use full source file name under DIRECTORY

       -R, -r, --recursive
              copy directories recursively

       --remove-destination
              remove each existing destination file before attempting to open it (contrast with --force)

       --sparse=WHEN
              control creation of sparse files

       --strip-trailing-slashes
              remove any trailing slashes from each SOURCE argument

       -s, --symbolic-link
              make symbolic links instead of copying

       -S, --suffix=SUFFIX
              override the usual backup suffix

       -t, --target-directory=DIRECTORY
              copy all SOURCE arguments into DIRECTORY

       -T, --no-target-directory
              treat DEST as a normal file

       -u, --update
              copy only when the SOURCE file is newer than the destination file  or  when  the  destination
              file is missing

       -v, --verbose
              explain what is being done

       -x, --one-file-system
              stay on this file system

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       By default, sparse SOURCE files are detected by a crude heuristic and the corresponding DEST file is
       made sparse as well.  That is the behavior selected by --sparse=auto.   Specify  --sparse=always  to
       create  a  sparse  DEST file whenever the SOURCE file contains a long enough sequence of zero bytes.
       Use --sparse=never to inhibit creation of sparse files.

       The backup suffix is ~, unless set with --suffix or  SIMPLE_BACKUP_SUFFIX.   The  version  control
       method  may be selected via the --backup option or through the VERSION_CONTROL environment variable.
       Here are the values:

       none, off
              never make backups (even if --backup is given)

       numbered, t
              make numbered backups

       existing, nil
              numbered if numbered backups exist, simple otherwise

       simple, never
              always make simple backups

       As a special case, cp makes a backup of SOURCE when the force  and  backup  options  are  given  and
       SOURCE and DEST are the same name for an existing, regular file.

EXAMPLES
       cp ~/somefile /bkp/
          copies somefile from the users home directory to the bkp directory
       cp -rvp ~/ /bkp/
          copy recursively everything from the users home dirctory to the bkp directory, displaying what is going on, and preserving permissions.

=== csplit ===
 Output  pieces  of FILE separated by PATTERN(s) to files "xx00", "xx01", ..., and output byte counts
       of each piece to standard output.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

       -b, --suffix-format=FORMAT
              use sprintf FORMAT instead of %02d

       -f, --prefix=PREFIX
              use PREFIX instead of 'xx'

       -k, --keep-files
              do not remove output files on errors

       -n, --digits=DIGITS
              use specified number of digits instead of 2

       -s, --quiet, --silent
              do not print counts of output file sizes

       -z, --elide-empty-files
              remove empty output files

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       Read standard input if FILE is -.  Each PATTERN may be:

       INTEGER
              copy up to but not including specified line number

       /REGEXP/[OFFSET]
              copy up to but not including a matching line

       %REGEXP%[OFFSET]
              skip to, but not including a matching line

       `{INTEGER}`
              repeat the previous pattern specified number of times

       `{*}`    repeat the previous pattern as many times as possible

       A line OFFSET is a required "+" or "-" followed by a positive integer.

=== cut ===
 Print selected parts of lines from each FILE to standard output.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

       -b, --bytes=LIST
              select only these bytes

       -c, --characters=LIST
              select only these characters

       -d, --delimiter=DELIM
              use DELIM instead of TAB for field delimiter

       -f, --fields=LIST
              select  only  these fields;  also print any line that contains no delimiter character, unless
              the -s option is specified

       -n     (ignored)

       --complement
              complement the set of selected bytes, characters or fields.

       -s, --only-delimited
              do not print lines not containing delimiters

       --output-delimiter=STRING
              use STRING as the output delimiter the default is to use the input delimiter

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       Use one, and only one of -b, -c or -f.  Each LIST is made up of one range, or many ranges  separated
       by  commas.   Selected  input  is  written in the same order that it is read, and is written exactly
       once.  Each range is one of:

       N      N'th byte, character or field, counted from 1

       N-     from N'th byte, character or field, to end of line

       N-M    from N'th to M'th (included) byte, character or field

       -M     from first to M'th (included) byte, character or field

       With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.


=== date ===
 Display the current time in the given FORMAT, or set the system date.

       -d, --date=STRING
              display time described by STRING, not "now"

       -f, --file=DATEFILE
              like --date once for each line of DATEFILE

       -r, --reference=FILE
              display the last modification time of FILE

       -R, --rfc-2822
              output date and time in RFC 2822 format.  Example: Mon, 07 Aug 2006 12:34:56 -0600

       --rfc-3339=TIMESPEC
              output  date  and  time in RFC 3339 format.  TIMESPEC="date", "seconds", or "ns" for date and
              time to the indicated precision.  Date and time components are separated by a  single  space:
              2006-08-07 12:34:56-06:00

       -s, --set=STRING
              set time described by STRING

       -u, --utc, --universal

       --help display this help and exit

       %m     month (01..12)

       %M     minute (00..59)

       %n     a newline

       %N     nanoseconds (000000000..999999999)

       %t     a tab

       %T     time; same as %H:%M:%S

       %u     day of week (1..7); 1 is Monday

       %U     week number of year, with Sunday as first day of week (00..53)

       %V     ISO week number, with Monday as first day of week (01..53)

       %w     day of week (0..6); 0 is Sunday

       %W     week number of year, with Monday as first day of week (00..53)

       %x     locale's date representation (e.g., 12/31/99)

       %X     locale's time representation (e.g., 23:13:48)

       %::z   +hh:mm:ss numeric time zone (e.g., -04:00:00)

       %:::z  numeric time zone with : to necessary precision (e.g., -04, +05:30)

       %Z     alphabetic time zone abbreviation (e.g., EDT)

       By default, date pads numeric fields with zeroes.  The following optional flags may follow "%":

       -      (hyphen) do not pad the field

       _      (underscore) pad with spaces

       0      (zero) pad with zeros

       ^      use upper case if possible

       `#`      use opposite case if possible

       After any flags comes an optional field width, as a decimal number; then an optional modifier, which
       is  either  E  to  use the locale's alternate representations if available, or O to use the locale's
       alternate numeric symbols if available.

=== df ===

This manual page documents the GNU version of df.  df displays the amount of disk space available on
       the file system containing each file name argument.  If no file name is given, the  space  available
       on all currently mounted file systems is shown.  Disk space is shown in 1K blocks by default, unless
       the environment variable POSIXLY_CORRECT is set, in which case 512-byte blocks are used.

       If an argument is the absolute file name of a disk device node containing a mounted file system,  df
       shows  the  space available on that file system rather than on the file system containing the device
       node (which is always the root file system).  This version of df cannot show the space available  on
       unmounted file systems, because on most kinds of systems doing so requires very nonportable intimate
       knowledge of file system structures.

       SIZE  may  be  (or  may  be an integer optionally followed by) one of following: kB 1000, K 1024, MB 1000*1000, M 1024*1024, and so on for G, T, P, E, Z, Y.

       By default, color is not  used  to  distinguish  types  of  files.   That  is  equivalent  to  using
       --color=none.   Using  the  --color option without the optional WHEN argument is equivalent to using
       --color=always.  With --color=auto, color codes are output only if standard output is connected to a
       terminal  (tty).  The environment variable LS_COLORS can influence the colors, and can be set easily
       by the dircolors command.

       Exit status is 0 if OK, 1 if minor problems, 2 if serious trouble.


=== dircolors ===
      Output commands to set the LS_COLORS environment variable.

   Determine format of output:
       -b, --sh, --bourne-shell
              output Bourne shell code to set LS_COLORS

       -c, --csh, --c-shell
              output C shell code to set LS_COLORS

       -p, --print-database
              output defaults

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       If  FILE is specified, read it to determine which colors to use for which file types and extensions.
       Otherwise, a precompiled database is used.  For details on the format of these files, run dircolors
       --print-database.

=== dirname ===

       Print  NAME  with  its trailing /component removed; if NAME contains no /'s, output '.' (meaning the
       current directory).

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

EXAMPLES
       dirname /usr/bin/sort
              Output "/usr/bin".

       dirname stdio.h
              Output ".".

=== du ===

Summarize disk usage of each FILE, recursively for directories.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

       -a, --all
              write counts for all files, not just directories

       --apparent-size
              print  apparent sizes, rather than disk usage; although the apparent size is usually smaller,
              it may be larger due to holes in (sparse) files, internal fragmentation,  indirect  blocks,
              and the like

       -B, --block-size=SIZE
              use SIZE-byte blocks

       -b, --bytes
              equivalent to "--apparent-size --block-size=1"

              produce a grand total

       -D, --dereference-args
              dereference only symlinks that are listed on the command line

       --files0-from=F
              summarize disk usage of the NUL-terminated file names specified in file F

       -H     like --si, but also evokes a warning; will soon change to be equivalent to --dereference-args
              (-D)

       -h, --human-readable
              print sizes in human readable format (e.g., 1K 234M 2G)

       --si   like -h, but use powers of 1000 not 1024

              end each output line with 0 byte rather than newline

       -S, --separate-dirs
              do not include size of subdirectories

       -s, --summarize
              display only a total for each argument

       -x, --one-file-system
              skip directories on different file systems

              Exclude files that match any pattern in FILE.

       --exclude=PATTERN
              Exclude files that match PATTERN.

       --max-depth=N
              print the total for a directory (or file, with --all) only if it is N or fewer  levels  below
              the command line argument;  --max-depth=0 is the same as --summarize

       --time show time of the last modification of any file in the directory, or any of its subdirectories

       --time=WORD
              show time as WORD instead of modification time: atime, access, use, ctime or status

       --time-style=STYLE
              show times using style STYLE: full-iso, long-iso, iso, +FORMAT  FORMAT  is  interpreted  like
              'date'

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       SIZE  may  be  (or  may  be an integer optionally followed by) one of following: kB 1000, K 1024, MB `1000*1000, M 1024*1024,` and so on for G, T, P, E, Z, Y.

PATTERNS
       PATTERN is a shell pattern (not a regular expression).  The pattern ?  matches  any  one  character,
       whereas  `*` matches any string (composed of zero, one or multiple characters).  For example, `*.o` will
       match any files whose names end in .o.  Therefore, the command

              du --exclude=`*.o`

       will skip all files and subdirectories ending in .o (including the file .o itself).

       ARG1 | ARG2
              ARG1 if it is neither null nor 0, otherwise ARG2

       ARG1 & ARG2
              ARG1 if neither argument is null or 0, otherwise 0

       ARG1 < ARG2
              ARG1 is less than ARG2

       ARG1 <= ARG2
              ARG1 is less than or equal to ARG2

       ARG1 = ARG2
              ARG1 is equal to ARG2

       ARG1 != ARG2
              ARG1 is unequal to ARG2

       ARG1 >= ARG2
              ARG1 is greater than or equal to ARG2

       ARG1 > ARG2
              ARG1 is greater than ARG2

       ARG1 + ARG2
              arithmetic sum of ARG1 and ARG2

       ARG1 - ARG2
              arithmetic difference of ARG1 and ARG2

       ARG1 `*` ARG2
              arithmetic product of ARG1 and ARG2

       ARG1 / ARG2
              arithmetic quotient of ARG1 divided by ARG2

       ARG1 % ARG2
              arithmetic remainder of ARG1 divided by ARG2

       STRING : REGEXP
              anchored pattern match of REGEXP in STRING

       match STRING REGEXP
              same as STRING : REGEXP

       substr STRING POS LENGTH
              substring of STRING, POS counted from 1

       index STRING CHARS
              index in STRING where any CHARS is found, or 0

       length STRING
              length of STRING

       + TOKEN
              interpret TOKEN as a string, even if it is a

              keyword like 'match' or an operator like "/"

       ( EXPRESSION )
              value of EXPRESSION

       Beware that many operators need to be escaped or quoted for shells.  Comparisons are  arithmetic  if
       both  ARGs  are numbers, else lexicographical.  Pattern matches return the string matched between \(
       and \) or null; if \( and \) are not used, they return the number of characters matched or 0.

       Exit status is 0 if EXPRESSION is neither null nor 0, 1 if EXPRESSION is null or 0, 2 if  EXPRESSION
       is syntactically invalid, and 3 if an error occurred.

=== nohup ===

       Run COMMAND, ignoring hangup signals.

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       If  standard  input  is  a  terminal, redirect it from /dev/null.  If standard output is a terminal,
       append output to "nohup.out" if possible, "$HOME/nohup.out" otherwise.  If standard error is a  terminal, redirect it to standard output.  To save output to FILE, use "nohup COMMAND > FILE".

       NOTE:  your  shell may have its own version of nohup, which usually supersedes the version described
       here.  Please refer to your shell's documentation for details about the options it supports.

=== od ===

       Write  an unambiguous representation, octal bytes by default, of FILE to standard output.  With more
       than one FILE argument, concatenate them in the listed order to form the input.  With  no  FILE,  or
       when FILE is -, read standard input.

       All arguments to long options are mandatory for short options.

       -A, --address-radix=RADIX
              decide how file offsets are printed

       -j, --skip-bytes=BYTES
              skip BYTES input bytes first

       -N, --read-bytes=BYTES
              limit dump to BYTES input bytes

       -S, --strings[=BYTES]
              output strings of at least BYTES graphic chars

       -t, --format=TYPE
              select output format or formats

       -v, --output-duplicates
             do not use `*` to mark line suppression

       -w, --width[=BYTES]
              output BYTES bytes per output line

       --traditional
              accept arguments in traditional form

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

   Traditional format specifications may be intermixed; they accumulate:
       -a     same as -t a,  select named characters, ignoring high-order bit

       -b     same as -t o1, select octal bytes

       -c     same as -t c,  select ASCII characters or backslash escapes

       -d     same as -t u2, select unsigned decimal 2-byte units

       -f     same as -t fF, select floats

       -i     same as -t dI, select decimal ints

       -l     same as -t dL, select decimal longs

       -o     same as -t o2, select octal 2-byte units

       -s     same as -t d2, select decimal 2-byte units

       -x     same as -t x2, select hexadecimal 2-byte units

       If first and second call formats both apply, the second format is assumed if the last operand begins
       with + or (if there are 2 operands) a digit.  An OFFSET operand  means  -j  OFFSET.   LABEL  is  the
       pseudo-address at first byte printed, incremented when dump is progressing.  For OFFSET and LABEL, a
       0x or 0X prefix indicates hexadecimal; suffixes may be . for octal and b for multiply by 512.

       TYPE is made up of one or more of these specifications:

       a      named character, ignoring high-order bit

       c      ASCII character or backslash escape

       d[SIZE]
              signed decimal, SIZE bytes per integer

       f[SIZE]
              floating point, SIZE bytes per integer

       o[SIZE]
              octal, SIZE bytes per integer

       u[SIZE]
              unsigned decimal, SIZE bytes per integer

       x[SIZE]
              hexadecimal, SIZE bytes per integer

       SIZE is a number.  For TYPE in doux, SIZE may also be C for sizeof(char), S for sizeof(short), I for
       sizeof(int)  or  L  for  sizeof(long).   If  TYPE  is f, SIZE may also be F for sizeof(float), D for
       sizeof(double) or L for sizeof(long double).

       RADIX is d for decimal, o for octal, x for hexadecimal or n for none.  BYTES is hexadecimal with  0x
       or  0X  prefix, and may have a multiplier suffix: b 512, kB 1000, K 1024, `MB 1000*1000, M 1024*1024,`
       `GB 1000*1000*1000, G 1024*1024*1024`, and so on for T, P, E, Z, Y.  Adding a z  suffix  to  any  type
       displays  printable characters at the end of each output line.  --string without a number implies 3.
       --width without a number implies 32.  By default, od uses -A o -t d2 -w16.

=== paste ===

=== readlink ===

       Display value of a symbolic link on standard output.

       -f, --canonicalize

       By default, rm does not remove directories.  Use the --recursive (-r or -R) option  to  remove  each
       listed directory, too, along with all of its contents.

       To remove a file whose name starts with a -, for example -foo, use one of these commands:

              rm -- -foo

              rm ./-foo

       Note  that  if  you  use rm to remove a file, it is usually possible to recover the contents of that
       file.  If you want more assurance that the contents are truly unrecoverable, consider using shred.

=== rmdir ===

      Remove the DIRECTORY(ies), if they are empty.

       --ignore-fail-on-non-empty

              ignore each failure that is solely because a directory is non-empty

       -p, --parents
              Remove  DIRECTORY  and  its ancestors.  E.g., rmdir -p a/b/c is similar to rmdir a/b/c a/b
              a.

       -v, --verbose
              output a diagnostic for every directory processed

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

=== sha1sum ===

       Print or check SHA1 (160-bit) checksums.  With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.

       -b, --binary
              read in binary mode

       -c, --check
              read SHA1 sums from the FILEs and check them

       -t, --text
              read in text mode (default)

   The following two options are useful only when verifying checksums:
       --status
              don't output anything, status code shows success

       -w, --warn
              warn about improperly formatted checksum lines

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       The  sums are computed as described in FIPS-180-1.  When checking, the input should be a former output of this program.  The default mode is to print a line with checksum, a character indicating type
       (`*` for binary, " " for text), and name for each FILE.

=== seq ===

       Print numbers from FIRST to LAST, in steps of INCREMENT.

       -f, --format=FORMAT
              use printf style floating-point FORMAT

       -s, --separator=STRING
              use STRING to separate numbers (default: \n)

       -w, --equal-width
              equalize width by padding with leading zeroes

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       If  FIRST  or  INCREMENT  is omitted, it defaults to 1.  That is, an omitted INCREMENT defaults to 1
       even when LAST is smaller than FIRST.  FIRST, INCREMENT, and LAST are interpreted as floating  point
       values.  INCREMENT is usually positive if FIRST is smaller than LAST, and INCREMENT is usually negative if FIRST is greater than LAST.  FORMAT must be suitable for printing one argument of type double;  it defaults to %.PRECf if FIRST, INCREMENT, and LAST are all fixed point decimal numbers with
       maximum precision PREC, and to %g otherwise.

=== shred ===

       Overwrite the specified FILE(s) repeatedly, in order to make it harder for even very expensive hardware probing to recover the data.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

       -f, --force
              change permissions to allow writing if necessary

       -n, --iterations=N
              Overwrite N times instead of the default (25)

       --random-source=FILE
              get random bytes from FILE (default /dev/urandom)

       -s, --size=N
              shred this many bytes (suffixes like K, M, G accepted)

       -u, --remove
              truncate and remove file after overwriting

       -v, --verbose
              show progress

       -x, --exact
              do not round file sizes up to the next full block;

              this is the default for non-regular files

       -z, --zero
              add a final overwrite with zeros to hide shredding

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       If FILE is -, shred standard output.

       Delete FILE(s) if --remove (-u) is specified.  The default is not to remove the files because it  is
       common  to  operate  on  device  files like /dev/hda, and those files usually should not be removed.
       When operating on regular files, most people use the --remove option.

       CAUTION: Note that shred relies on a very important assumption: that the file system overwrites data
       in place.  This is the traditional way to do things, but many modern file system designs do not satisfy this assumption.  The following are examples of file systems on which shred is  not  effective,
       or is not guaranteed to be effective in all file system modes:

       `*`  log-structured  or  journaled file systems, such as those supplied with AIX and Solaris (and JFS,
       ReiserFS, XFS, Ext3, etc.)

       `*` file systems that write redundant data and carry on even if some writes fail, such  as  RAID-based
       file systems

       `*` file systems that make snapshots, such as Network Appliance's NFS server

       `*` file systems that cache in temporary locations, such as NFS version 3 clients

       `*` compressed file systems

       In  the case of ext3 file systems, the above disclaimer applies (and shred is thus of limited effectiveness) only in data=journal mode, which journals file data in addition to just metadata.  In both
       the  data=ordered  (default)  and data=writeback modes, shred works as usual.  Ext3 journaling modes
       can be changed by adding the data=something option to the mount options for a particular file system
       in the /etc/fstab file, as documented in the mount man page (man mount).

       In  addition,  file  system backups and remote mirrors may contain copies of the file that cannot be
       removed, and that will allow a shredded file to be recovered later.


=== sleep ===

       Pause  for  NUMBER  seconds.   SUFFIX may be s for seconds (the default), m for minutes, h for
       hours or d for days.  Unlike most implementations that require NUMBER be an integer,  here  NUMBER
       may  be  an  arbitrary  floating point number.  Given two or more arguments, pause for the amount of
       time specified by the sum of their values.

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit


=== sort ===
       Write sorted concatenation of all FILE(s) to standard output.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.  Ordering options:

       -b, --ignore-leading-blanks
              ignore leading blanks

       -d, --dictionary-order
              consider only blanks and alphanumeric characters

       -f, --ignore-case
              fold lower case to upper case characters

       -g, --general-numeric-sort
              compare according to general numerical value

       -i, --ignore-nonprinting
              consider only printable characters

       -M, --month-sort
              compare (unknown) < JAN < ... < DEC

       -n, --numeric-sort
              compare according to string numerical value

       -R, --random-sort
              sort by random hash of keys

       --random-source=FILE
              get random bytes from FILE (default /dev/urandom)

       -r, --reverse
              reverse the result of comparisons

       Other options:

       -c, --check, --check=diagnose-first
              check for sorted input; do not sort

       -C, --check=quiet, --check=silent
              like -c, but do not report first bad line

       --compress-program=PROG
              compress temporaries with PROG; decompress them with PROG -d

       -k, --key=POS1[,POS2]
              start a key at POS1, end it at POS2 (origin 1)

       -m, --merge
              merge already sorted files; do not sort

       -o, --output=FILE
              write result to FILE instead of standard output

       -s, --stable
              stabilize sort by disabling last-resort comparison

       -S, --buffer-size=SIZE
              use SIZE for main memory buffer

       -t, --field-separator=SEP
              use SEP instead of non-blank to blank transition

       -T, --temporary-directory=DIR
              use DIR for temporaries, not $TMPDIR or /tmp; multiple options specify multiple directories

       -u, --unique
              with -c, check for strict ordering; without -c, output only the first of an equal run

       -z, --zero-terminated
              end lines with 0 byte, not newline

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       POS  is F[.C][OPTS], where F is the field number and C the character position in the field; both are
       origin 1.  If neither -t nor -b is in effect, characters in a field are counted from  the  beginning
       of  the  preceding  whitespace.   OPTS is one or more single-letter ordering options, which override
       global ordering options for that key.  If no key is given, use the entire line as the key.

       SIZE may be followed by the following  multiplicative  suffixes:  %  1%  of  memory,  b  1,  K  1024
       (default), and so on for M, G, T, P, E, Z, Y.

       With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.

       `*** WARNING ***` The locale specified by the environment affects sort order.  Set LC`_`ALL=C to get the
       traditional sort order that uses native byte values.


=== split ===

      Output  fixed-size  pieces  of  INPUT  to  PREFIXaa,  PREFIXab, ...; default size is 1000 lines, and
       default PREFIX is x.  With no INPUT, or when INPUT is -, read standard input.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

       -a, --suffix-length=N
              use suffixes of length N (default 2)

       -b, --bytes=SIZE
              put SIZE bytes per output file

       -C, --line-bytes=SIZE
              put at most SIZE bytes of lines per output file

       -d, --numeric-suffixes
              use numeric suffixes instead of alphabetic

       -l, --lines=NUMBER
              put NUMBER lines per output file

       --verbose
              print a diagnostic to standard error just before each output file is opened

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       `SIZE may have a multiplier  suffix:  b  512,  kB  1000,  K  1024,  MB  1000*1000,  M  1024*1024,  GB 1000*1000*1000, G 1024*1024*1024`, and so on for T, P, E, Z, Y.


=== stat ===

       Display file or file system status.

       -L, --dereference
              follow links

       -f, --file-system
              display file system status instead of file status

       -c  --format=FORMAT
              use the specified FORMAT instead of the default; output a newline after each use of FORMAT

       --printf=FORMAT
              like  --format,  but interpret backslash escapes, and do not output a mandatory trailing newline.  If you want a newline, include \n in FORMAT.

       -t, --terse
              print the information in terse form

       --help display this help and exit

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

=== tac ===

      Write each FILE to standard output, last line first.  With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard
       input.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

       -b, --before
              attach the separator before instead of after

       -r, --regex
              interpret the separator as a regular expression

       -s, --separator=STRING
              use STRING as the separator instead of newline

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit


=== tail ===

      Print the last 10 lines of each FILE to standard output.  With more than one FILE, precede each with
       a header giving the file name.  With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

       --retry
              keep trying to open a file even if it is inaccessible when tail starts or if it becomes inaccessible later; useful when following by name, i.e., with --follow=name

       -c, --bytes=N
              output  the last N bytes; alternatively, use +N to output bytes starting with the Nth of each
              file

       -f, --follow[={name|descriptor}]
              output appended data as the file grows; -f, --follow, and --follow=descriptor are equivalent

       -F     same as --follow=name --retry

       -n, --lines=N
              output the last N lines, instead of the last 10; or use +N to output lines starting with  the
              Nth

       --max-unchanged-stats=N
              with  --follow=name,  reopen a FILE which has not changed size after N (default 5) iterations
              to see if it has been unlinked or renamed (this is the usual case of rotated log files)

       --pid=PID
              with -f, terminate after process ID, PID dies

       -q, --quiet, --silent
              never output headers giving file names

       -s, --sleep-interval=S
              with -f, sleep for approximately S seconds (default 1.0) between iterations.

       -v, --verbose
              always output headers giving file names

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       If the first character of N (the number of bytes or lines) is a +, print beginning  with  the  Nth
       item  from the start of each file, otherwise, print the last N items in the file.  `N may have a multiplier suffix:  b  512,  kB  1000,  K  1024,  MB  1000*1000,  M  1024*1024,  GB  1000*1000*1000,  G 1024*1024*1024, and so on for T, P, E, Z, Y.`

       With  --follow  (-f),  tail  defaults  to  following the file descriptor, which means that even if a
       tailed file is renamed, tail will continue to track its end.  This default behavior is  not  desirable  when  you really want to track the actual name of the file, not the file descriptor (e.g., log
       rotation).  Use --follow=name in that case.  That causes tail to track the named file  by  reopening
       it periodically to see if it has been removed and recreated by some other program.


=== tee ===

       Copy standard input to each FILE, and also to standard output.

       -a, --append
              append to the given FILEs, do not overwrite

       -i, --ignore-interrupts
              ignore interrupt signals

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       If a FILE is -, copy again to standard output.


=== test ===

       Exit with the status determined by EXPRESSION.

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       An  omitted EXPRESSION defaults to false.  Otherwise, EXPRESSION is true or false and sets exit status.  It is one of:

       ( EXPRESSION )
              EXPRESSION is true

       ! EXPRESSION
              EXPRESSION is false

       EXPRESSION1 -a EXPRESSION2
              both EXPRESSION1 and EXPRESSION2 are true

       EXPRESSION1 -o EXPRESSION2
              either EXPRESSION1 or EXPRESSION2 is true

       -n STRING
              the length of STRING is nonzero

       STRING equivalent to -n STRING

       -z STRING
              the length of STRING is zero

       STRING1 = STRING2
              the strings are equal

       STRING1 != STRING2
              the strings are not equal

       INTEGER1 -eq INTEGER2
              INTEGER1 is equal to INTEGER2

       INTEGER1 -ge INTEGER2
              INTEGER1 is greater than or equal to INTEGER2

       INTEGER1 -gt INTEGER2
              INTEGER1 is greater than INTEGER2

       INTEGER1 -le INTEGER2
              INTEGER1 is less than or equal to INTEGER2

       INTEGER1 -lt INTEGER2
              INTEGER1 is less than INTEGER2

       INTEGER1 -ne INTEGER2
              INTEGER1 is not equal to INTEGER2

       FILE1 -ef FILE2
              FILE1 and FILE2 have the same device and inode numbers

       FILE1 -nt FILE2
              FILE1 is newer (modification date) than FILE2

       FILE1 -ot FILE2
              FILE1 is older than FILE2

       -b FILE
              FILE exists and is block special

       -c FILE
              FILE exists and is character special

       -d FILE
              FILE exists and is a directory

       -e FILE
              FILE exists

       -f FILE
              FILE exists and is a regular file

       -g FILE

       -G FILE
              FILE exists and is owned by the effective group ID

       -h FILE
              FILE exists and is a symbolic link (same as -L)

       -k FILE
              FILE exists and has its sticky bit set

       -L FILE
              FILE exists and is a symbolic link (same as -h)

       -O FILE
              FILE exists and is owned by the effective user ID

       -p FILE
              FILE exists and is a named pipe

       -x FILE
              FILE exists and execute (or search) permission is granted

       Except for -h and -L, all FILE-related tests dereference symbolic links.   Beware  that  parentheses
       need  to  be escaped (e.g., by backslashes) for shells.  INTEGER may also be -l STRING, which evaluates to the length of STRING.

       NOTE: [ honors the --help and --version options, but test does not.  test treats each of those as it
       treats any other nonempty STRING.

       NOTE:  your  shell  may  have its own version of test and/or [, which usually supersedes the version
       described here.  Please refer to your shell's documentation for details about the  options  it  supports.


=== touch ===

       Update the access and modification times of each FILE to the current time.

       A FILE argument that does not exist is created empty.

       A  FILE  argument  string of - is handled specially and causes touch to change the times of the file
       associated with standard output.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

       -a     change only the access time

       -c, --no-create
              do not create any files

       -d, --date=STRING

       --time=WORD
              change the specified time: WORD is access, atime, or use: equivalent to -a WORD is modify  or
              mtime: equivalent to -m

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       Note that the -d and -t options accept different time-date formats.

=== tr ===

       Translate, squeeze, and/or delete characters from standard input, writing to standard output.

       -c, -C, --complement
              first complement SET1

       -d, --delete
              delete characters in SET1, do not translate

       -s, --squeeze-repeats
              replace  each  input  sequence  of  a repeated character that is listed in SET1 with a single
              occurrence of that character

       -t, --truncate-set1
              first truncate SET1 to length of SET2

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       SETs are specified as strings of characters.  Most represent themselves.  Interpreted sequences are:

       \NNN   character with octal value NNN (1 to 3 octal digits)

       \\     backslash

       \a     audible BEL

       \b     backspace

       \f     form feed

       \n     new line

       \r     return

       \t     horizontal tab

       \v     vertical tab

       CHAR1-CHAR2
              all characters from CHAR1 to CHAR2 in ascending order

       [CHAR*]
              in SET2, copies of CHAR until length of SET1

       [CHAR*REPEAT]
              REPEAT copies of CHAR, REPEAT octal if starting with 0

       [:alnum:]
              all letters and digits

       [:alpha:]
              all letters

       [:blank:]
              all horizontal whitespace

       [:cntrl:]
              all control characters

       [:digit:]
              all digits

       [:graph:]

       [:print:]
              all printable characters, including space

       [:punct:]
              all punctuation characters

       [:space:]
              all horizontal or vertical whitespace

       [:upper:]

       [:xdigit:]
              all hexadecimal digits

       [=CHAR=]
              all characters which are equivalent to CHAR

       Translation  occurs  if  -d  is  not  given and both SET1 and SET2 appear.  -t may be used only when
       translating.  SET2 is extended to length of SET1 by  repeating  its  last  character  as  necessary.
       Excess  characters  of  SET2  are ignored.  Only [:lower:] and [:upper:] are guaranteed to expand in
       ascending order; used in SET2 while translating, they may only be used in pairs to specify case conversion.   -s  uses  SET1 if not translating nor deleting; else squeezing uses SET2 and occurs after
       translation or deletion.

       -S     sort by file size

       --sort=WORD
              sort by WORD instead of name: none -U, extension -X, size -S, time -t, version -v

       --time=WORD
              with -l, show time as WORD instead of modification time: atime -u, access -u, use  -u,  ctime
              -c, or status -c; use specified time as sort key if --sort=time

       --time-style=STYLE
              with  -l,  show times using style STYLE: full-iso, long-iso, iso, locale, +FORMAT.  FORMAT is
              interpreted like 'date'; if FORMAT is FORMAT1<newline>FORMAT2, FORMAT1 applies to  non-recent
              files  and  FORMAT2  to  recent files; if STYLE is prefixed with posix-, STYLE takes effect
              only outside the POSIX locale

       -t     sort by modification time

       -T, --tabsize=COLS
              assume tab stops at each COLS instead of 8

       SIZE  may  be  (or  may  be an integer optionally followed by) one of following: `kB 1000, K 1024, MB 1000*1000, M 1024*1024, and so on for G, T, P, E, Z, Y.`

       By default, color is not  used  to  distinguish  types  of  files.   That  is  equivalent  to  using
       --color=none.   Using  the  --color option without the optional WHEN argument is equivalent to using
       --color=always.  With --color=auto, color codes are output only if standard output is connected to a
       terminal  (tty).  The environment variable LS`_`COLORS can influence the colors, and can be set easily
       by the dircolors command.

       Exit status is 0 if OK, 1 if minor problems, 2 if serious trouble.

== Disk Utils ==

=== parted ===

      parted  is  a  disk  partitioning and partition resizing program.  It allows you to create, destroy,
       resize, move and copy ext2, ext3, linux-swap, FAT, FAT32, and reiserfs partitions.  It  can  create,
       resize, and move Macintosh HFS partitions, as well as detect jfs, ntfs, ufs, and xfs partitions.  It
       is useful for creating space for new operating systems, reorganising disk usage, and copying data to
       new hard disks.

       This  manual  page documents parted briefly.  Complete documentation is distributed with the package
       in GNU Info format; see near the bottom.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              displays a help message

       -i, --interactive
              prompts for user intervention

       -l, --list
              lists partition layout on all block devices

       -m, --machine
              displays machine parseable output

       -s, --script
              never prompts for user intervention

       -v, --version
              displays the version

COMMANDS
       [device]
              The block device to be used.  When none is given, parted will use the first block  device  it
              finds.

       [command [options]]
              Specifies  the command to be executed.  If no command is given, parted will present a command
              prompt.  Possible commands are:

              check partition
                     Do a simple check on partition.

              cp [source-device] source dest
                     Copy the source partition's filesystem on source-device (or the current device  if  no
                     other device was specified) to the dest partition on the current device.

              help [command]
                     Print general help, or help on command if specified.

              mkfs partition fs-type
                     Make  a  filesystem  fs-type  on  partition.  fs-type  can be one of "fat16", "fat32",
                     "ext2", "linux-swap", or "reiserfs".

              mklabel label-type
                     Create a new disklabel (partition table) of label-type.  label-type should be  one  of
                     "bsd", "dvh", "gpt", "loop", "mac", "msdos", "pc98", or "sun".

              mkpart part-type [fs-type] start end
                     Make  a part-type partition with filesystem fs-type (if specified), beginning at start
                     and ending at end (by default in megabytes).  fs-type can be one of "fat16",  "fat32",
                     "ext2", "HFS", "linux-swap", "NTFS", "reiserfs", or "ufs".  part-type should be one of
                     "primary", "logical", or "extended".

              mkpartfs part-type fs-type start end
                     Make a part-type partition with filesystem fs-type beginning at start  and  ending  at
                     end (by default in megabytes).

              move partition start end
                     Move  partition  so that it begins at start and ends at end.  Note: move never changes
                     the minor number.

              name partition name
                     Set the name of partition to name. This option  works  only  on  Mac,  PC98,  and  GPT
                     disklabels. The name can be placed in quotes, if necessary.

              print  Display the partition table.

              quit   Exit from parted.

              rescue start end
                     Rescue a lost partition that was located somewhere between start and end.  If a partition is found, parted will ask if you want to create an entry for it in the  partition
                     table.

              resize partition start end
                     Resize  the  filesystem  on  partition  so that it begins at start and ends at end (by
                     default in megabytes).

              rm partition
                     Delete partition.

              select device
                     Choose device as the current device to edit. device should usually  be  a  Linux  hard
                     disk device, but it can be a partition, software raid device, or an LVM logical volume
                     if necessary.

              set partition flag state
                     Change the state of the flag on partition to  state.   Supported  flags  are:  "boot",
                     "root",  "swap",  "hidden",  "raid", "lvm", "lba", and "palo".  state should be either
                     "on" or "off".

              unit unit
                     Set unit as the unit to use when displaying locations and sizes, and for  interpreting
                     those  given  by the user when not suffixed with an explicit unit.  unit can be one of
                     "s" (sectors), "B" (bytes), "kB", "MB", "GB", "TB", "%" (percentage of  device  size),
                     "cyl"  (cylinders),  "chs"  (cylinders,  heads,  sectors), or "compact" (megabytes for
                     input, and a human-friendly form for output).

              version
                     Display version information and a copyright message.

KNOWN ISSUES
       ext3 filesystem resizing does not currently work, please use resize2fs(8) instead.

       Resizing partitions with an ext3 filesystem will not generally work because of the above issue.  Use
       resize2fs(8)  to resize the filesystem and resize the partition manually using fdisk(8) or a similar
       tool.  For LVM situations, you will need to use the LVM commands to resize the LVM elements.

=== badblocks ===

      badblocks  is  used  to search for bad blocks on a device (usually a disk partition).  device is the
       special file corresponding to the device (e.g /dev/hdc1).   last-block  is  the  last  block  to  be
       checked;  if it is not specified, the last block on the device is used as a default.  first-block is
       an optional parameter specifying the starting block number for the test, which allows the testing to
       start  in  the  middle of the disk.  If it is not specified the first block on the disk is used as a
       default.

       Important note: If the output of badblocks is going to be fed to the e2fsck or mke2fs  programs,  it
       is  important that the block size is properly specified, since the block numbers which are generated
       are very dependent on the block size in use by the filesystem.  For this reason, it is strongly recommended  that  users  not  run  badblocks  directly, but rather use the -c option of the e2fsck and
       mke2fs programs.

OPTIONS
       -b block-size
              Specify the size of blocks in bytes.  The default is 1024.

       -c number of blocks
              is the number of blocks which are tested at a time.  The default is 64.

       -e max bad block count
              Specify a maximum number of bad blocks before aborting the test.  The default is  0,  meaning
              the test will continue until the end of the test range is reached.

       -d read delay factor
              This parameter, if passed and non-zero, will cause bad blocks to sleep between reads if there
              were no errors encountered in the read operation; the delay will be calculated as a  percentage  of  the  time it took for the read operation to be performed. In other words, a value of
              100 will cause each read to be delayed by the amount the previous read took, and a  value  of
              200 by twice the amount.

       -f     Normally,  badblocks  will  refuse  to  do a read/write or a non-destructive test on a device
              which is mounted, since either can cause the system to potentially crash  and/or  damage  the
              filesystem  even  if  it is mounted read-only.  This can be overridden using the -f flag, but
              should almost never be used --- if you think you're smarter than the badblocks  program,  you
              almost  certainly  aren't.   The  only  time  when this option might be safe to use is if the
              /etc/mtab file is incorrect, and the device really isn't mounted.

       -i input`_`file
              Read a list of already existing known bad blocks.  Badblocks will skip testing  these  blocks
              since  they  are  known  to be bad.  If input`_`file is specified as "-", the list will be read
              from the standard input.  Blocks listed in this list will be omitted from the list of new bad
              blocks  produced  on the standard output or in the output file.  The -b option of dumpe2fs(8)
              can be used to retrieve the list of blocks currently marked bad on an existing filesystem, in
              a format suitable for use with this option.

       -o output`_`file
              Write  the list of bad blocks to the specified file.  Without this option, badblocks displays
              the list on its standard output.  The format of this file is  suitable  for  use  by  the  -l
              option in e2fsck(8) or mke2fs(8).

       -p num`_`passes
              Repeat  scanning  the disk until there are no new blocks discovered in num`_`passes consecutive
              scans of the disk.  Default is 0, meaning badblocks will exit after the first pass.

       -t test`_`pattern
              Specify a test pattern to be read (and written) to disk blocks.   The test`_`pattern may either
              be a numeric value between 0 and ULONG`_`MAX-1 inclusive, or the word "random", which specifies
              that the block should be filled with a random bit pattern.   For  read/write  (-w)  and  non-
              destructive  (-n)  modes,  one  or  more  test patterns may be specified by specifying the -t
              option for each test pattern desired.  For read-only mode only a single pattern may be specified and it may not be "random".  Read-only testing with a pattern assumes that the specified
              pattern has previously been written to the disk - if not, large numbers of blocks  will  fail
              verification.   If  multiple  patterns  are specified then all blocks will be tested with one
              pattern before proceeding to the next pattern.

       -n     Use non-destructive read-write mode.  By default only a  non-destructive  read-only  test  is
              done.  This option must not be combined with the -w option, as they are mutually exclusive.

       -s     Show the progress of the scan by writing out the block numbers as they are checked.

       -v     Verbose mode.

       -w     Use  write-mode  test.  With this option, badblocks scans for bad blocks by writing some patterns (0xaa, 0x55, 0xff, 0x00) on every block of the device, reading every block and  comparing  the  contents.  This option may not be combined with the -n option, as they are mutually
              exclusive.

       -X     Internal flag only to be used by e2fsck(8) and mke2fs(8).  It bypasses the exclusive mode in-
              use device safety check.

WARNING
       Never  use  the  -w option on a device containing an existing file system.  This option erases data!
       If you want to do write-mode testing on an existing file system, use the -n option instead.   It  is
       slower, but it will preserve your data.

       The  -e option will cause badblocks to output a possibly incomplete list of bad blocks. Therefore it
 is recommended to use it only when one wants to know if there are any  bad  blocks  at  all  on  the
       device, and not when the list of bad blocks is wanted.


=== blkid  ===
      The blkid program is the command-line interface to working with libblkid(3) library.  It can  determine  the type of content (e.g. filesystem, swap) a block device holds, and also attributes (tokens,
       NAME=value pairs) from the content metadata (e.g. LABEL or UUID fields).

       blkid has two main forms of operation: either searching for a  device  with  a  specific  NAME=value
       pair, or displaying NAME=value pairs for one or more devices.


=== e2fsck ===

      -c cachefile
              Read  from  cachefile  instead of reading from the default cache file /etc/blkid.tab.  If you
              want to start with a clean cache (i.e. don't report devices previously scanned but not necessarily available at this time), specify /dev/null.

       -g     Perform a garbage collection pass on the blkid cache to remove devices which no longer exist.

       -h     Display a usage message and exit.

       -l     Look up one device that matches the search parameter specified using the -t option.  If there
              are  multiple  devices  that  match  the specified search parameter, then the device with the
              highest priority is returned, and/or the first device found  at  a  given  priority.   Device
              types  in  order of decreasing priority are Device Mapper, EVMS, LVM, MD, and finally regular
              block devices.  If this option is not specified, blkid will print all  of  the  devices  that
              match the search parameter.

       -o format
              Display  blkid's  output  using  the specified format.  The format parameter may be full (the
              default), value (only print the value of the tags),  list  (print  the  devices  in  a  user-
              friendly format), or device (only print the device name).

       -L     Print the devices in a user-friendly list format.  This is the equivalent of using the option
              -o list.

       -s tag For each (specified) device, show only the tags that match tag.  It is  possible  to  specify
              multiple  -s  options.  If no tag is specified, then all tokens are shown for all (specified)
              devices.  In order to just refresh the cache without showing any tokens, use -s none with  no
              other options.

       -t NAME=value
              Search  for  block  devices with tokens named NAME that have the value value, and display any
              devices which are found.  Common values for NAME include TYPE, LABEL, and UUID.  If there are
              no  devices specified on the command line, all block devices will be searched; otherwise only
              the specified devices are searched.

       -v     Display version number and exit.

       -w writecachefile
              Write the device cache to writecachefile instead of writing it  to  the  default  cache  file
              /etc/blkid.tab.   If you don't want to save the cache to the default file, specify /dev/null.
              If not specified it will be the same file as that given by the -c option.

       device Display tokens from only the specified device.   It  is  possible  to  give  multiple  device
              options  on the command line.  If none is given, all devices which appear in /proc/partitions
              are shown, if they are recognized.
RETURN CODE
       If the specified token was found, or if any tags were shown from (specified) devices, 0 is returned.
       If the specified token was not found, or no (specified) devices could be identified, an exit code of
       2 is returned.  For usage or other errors, an exit code of 4 is returned.


=== mke2fs ===

      mke2fs is used to create an ext2/ext3 filesystem (usually in a disk partition).  device is the  special  file corresponding to the device (e.g /dev/hdXX).  blocks-count is the number of blocks on the
       device.  If omitted, mke2fs automagically figures the file system size.  If called  as  mkfs.ext3  a
       journal is created as if the -j option was specified.

       -b block-size
              Specify  the  size of blocks in bytes.  Valid block-size values are 1024, 2048 and 4096 bytes
              per block.  If omitted, block-size is heuristically determined by the filesystem size and the
              expected usage of the filesystem (see the -T option).  If block-size is negative, then mke2fs
              will use heuristics to determine the appropriate block size, with  the  constraint  that  the
              block  size  will  be at least block-size bytes.  This is useful for certain hardware devices
              which require that the blocksize be a multiple of 2k.

       -c     Check the device for bad blocks before creating the file system.  If this option is specified
              twice, then a slower read-write test is used instead of a fast read-only test.

       -E extended-options
              Set  extended options for the filesystem.  Extended options are comma separated, and may take
              an argument using the equals (=) sign.  The -E option used to be -R in earlier versions  of
              mke2fs.   The  -R  option  is  still  accepted  for  backwards compatibility.   The following
              extended options are supported:

                   stride=stride-size
                          Configure the filesystem for a RAID array  with  stride-size  filesystem  blocks.
                          This  is  the  number of blocks read or written to disk before moving to the next
                          disk, which is sometimes referred to as the  chunk  size.   This  mostly  affects
                          placement  of  filesystem  metadata  like bitmaps at mke2fs time to avoid placing
                          them on a single disk, which can hurt performance.  It may also be  used  by  the
                          block allocator.

                   stripe-width=stripe-width
                          Configure the filesystem for a RAID array with stripe-width filesystem blocks per
                          stripe. This is typically stride-size `*` N, where N is the number of  data-bearing
                          disks  in  the  RAID  (e.g. for RAID 5 there is one parity disk, so N will be the
                          number of disks in the array minus 1).  This allows the block allocator  to  prevent  read-modify-write  of the parity in a RAID stripe if possible when the data
                          is written.

                   resize=max-online-resize
                          Reserve enough space so that the block group descriptor table can grow to support
                          a filesystem that has max-online-resize blocks.

                   `lazy_itable_init`[= <0 to disable, 1 to enable>]
                          If  enabled  and  the  uninit`_`bg  feature is enabled, the inode table will not be
                          fully initialized by mke2fs.  This speeds up  filesystem  initialization  noticeably,  but  it  requires  the kernel to finish initializing the filesystem in the
                          background when the filesystem is first mounted.  If the option value is omitted,
                          it defaults to 1 to enable lazy inode table initialization.


                   test`_`fs
                          Set  a  flag in the filesystem superblock indicating that it may be mounted using
                          experimental kernel code, such as the ext4dev filesystem.

       -f fragment-size
              Specify the size of fragments in bytes.

       -F     Force mke2fs to create a filesystem, even if the specified device is not  a  partition  on  a
              block  special device, or if other parameters do not make sense.  In order to force mke2fs to
              create a filesystem even if the filesystem appears to be in use or is mounted (a  truly  dangerous thing to do), this option must be specified twice.

       -g blocks-per-group
              Specify  the number of blocks in a block group.  There is generally no reason for the user to
              ever set this parameter, as the default is optimal for the filesystem.   (For  administrators
              who  are creating filesystems on RAID arrays, it is preferable to use the stride RAID parameter as part of the -E option rather than manipulating the number of blocks per group.)   This
              option is generally used by developers who are developing test cases.

       -G number-of-groups
              Specify  the  number of block groups that will be packed together to create one large virtual
              block group on an ext4 filesystem.  This improves meta-data locality and performance on meta-
              data heavy workloads.  The number of groups must be a power of 2 and may only be specified if
              the flex`_`bg filesystem feature is enabled.

       -i bytes-per-inode
              Specify the bytes/inode ratio.  mke2fs creates an inode for every  bytes-per-inode  bytes  of
              space  on  the disk.  The larger the bytes-per-inode ratio, the fewer inodes will be created.
              This value generally shouldn't be smaller than the blocksize of the filesystem, since in that
              case  more  inodes would be made than can ever be used.  Be warned that it is not possible to
              expand the number of inodes on a filesystem after it is created, so be careful  deciding  the
              correct value for this parameter.

       -I inode-size
              Specify the size of each inode in bytes.  mke2fs creates 256-byte inodes by default.  In kernels after 2.6.10 and some earlier vendor kernels it is possible  to  utilize  inodes  larger
              than  128  bytes to store extended attributes for improved performance.  The inode-size value
              must be a power of 2 larger or equal to 128.  The larger the inode-size the  more  space  the
              inode  table  will  consume, and this reduces the usable space in the filesystem and can also
              negatively impact performance.  Extended attributes stored in large inodes  are  not  visible
              with  older  kernels, and such filesystems will not be mountable with 2.4 kernels at all.  It
              is not possible to change this value after the filesystem is created.

       -j     Create the filesystem with an ext3 journal.  If the -J option is not specified,  the  default
              journal  parameters  will be used to create an appropriately sized journal (given the size of
              the filesystem) stored within the filesystem.  Note that you must be using a kernel which has
              ext3 support in order to actually make use of the journal.

       -J journal-options
              Create  the  ext3  journal  using options specified on the command-line.  Journal options are
              comma separated, and may take an argument using the equals (`=`)  sign.  The following  journal options are supported:

                   size=journal-size
                          Create  an internal journal (i.e., stored inside the filesystem) of size journal-
                          size megabytes.  The size of the journal must be at least 1024 filesystem  blocks
                          (i.e.,  1MB if using 1k blocks, 4MB if using 4k blocks, etc.)  and may be no more
                          than 102,400 filesystem blocks.

                   device=external-journal
                          Attach the filesystem to the journal block device  located  on  external-journal.
                          The external journal must already have been created using the command

                          mke2fs -O journal`_`dev external-journal

                          Note that external-journal must have been created with the same block size as the
                          new filesystem.  In addition, while  there  is  support  for  attaching  multiple
                          filesystems  to  a single external journal, the Linux kernel and e2fsck(8) do not
                          currently support shared external journals yet.

                          Instead of specifying a device name directly, external-journal can also be specified  by either LABEL=label or UUID=UUID to locate the external journal by either
                          the volume label or UUID stored in the ext2 superblock at the start of the  journal.   Use  dumpe2fs(8) to display a journal device's volume label and UUID.  See
                          also the -L option of tune2fs(8).

              Only one of the size or device options can be given for a filesystem.

       -l filename
              Read the bad blocks list from filename.  Note that the block numbers in the  bad  block  list
              must be generated using the same block size as used by mke2fs.  As a result, the -c option to
              mke2fs is a much simpler and less error-prone method of checking a disk for bad blocks before
              formatting it, as mke2fs will automatically pass the correct parameters to the badblocks program.

       -L new-volume-label
              Set the volume label for the filesystem to new-volume-label.  The maximum length of the  volume label is 16 bytes.

       -m reserved-blocks-percentage
              Specify  the  percentage  of  the filesystem blocks reserved for the super-user.  This avoids
              fragmentation, and allows root-owned daemons, such as syslogd(8),  to  continue  to  function
              correctly  after  non-privileged processes are prevented from writing to the filesystem.  The
              default percentage is 5%.

       -M last-mounted-directory
              Set the last mounted directory for the filesystem.  This might be  useful  for  the  sake  of
              utilities that key off of the last mounted directory to determine where the filesystem should
              be mounted.

       -n     Causes mke2fs to not actually create a filesystem, but display what it would do if it were to
              create  a  filesystem.   This can be used to determine the location of the backup superblocks
              for a particular filesystem, so long as the mke2fs  parameters  that  were  passed  when  the
              filesystem was originally created are used again.  (With the -n option added, of course!)

       -N number-of-inodes
              Overrides  the  default  calculation  of the number of inodes that should be reserved for the
              filesystem (which is based on the number of blocks  and  the  bytes-per-inode  ratio).   This
              allows the user to specify the number of desired inodes directly.

       -o creator-os
              Overrides  the  default value of the "creator operating system" field of the filesystem.  The
              creator field is set by default to the name of the OS the mke2fs executable was compiled for.

       -O feature[,...]
              Create  a  filesystem  with  the  given features (filesystem options), overriding the default
              filesystem options.  The features that are enabled by default are specified by the  base`-`features  relation, either in the [defaults] section in the /etc/mke2fs.conf configuration file,
              or in the [fs`_`types] subsections for the usage types as specified by the -T  option,  further
              modified  by the features relation found in the [fs`_`types] subsections for the filesystem and
              usage types.  See the mke2fs.conf(5) manual page for more details.  The filesystem  type-specific  configuration setting found in the [fs`_`types] section will override the global default
              found in [defaults].

              The filesystem feature set will be further edited using either the feature set  specified  by
              this  option,  or  if  this  option  is  not  given, by the default`_`features relation for the
              filesystem type being created, or in the [defaults] section of the configuration file.


              The filesystem feature set is comprised of a list of features, separated by commas, that  are
              to  be  enabled.   To  disable  a feature, simply prefix the feature name with a  caret (`^`)
              character.  The pseudo-filesystem feature "none" will clear all filesystem features.

                   `large_file`
                          Filesystem can contain files that are greater than 2GB.  (Modern kernels set this
                          feature automatically when a file > 2GB is created.)

                   `dir_index`
                          Use hashed b-trees to speed up lookups in large directories.

                   filetype
                          Store file type information in directory entries.

                   `flex_bg`
                          Allow  bitmaps  and  inode  tables for a block group to be placed anywhere on the
                          storage media (use with -G option to group meta-data in order to create  a  large
                          virtual block group).

                   `has_journal`
                          Create an ext3 journal (as if using the -j option).

                   `journal_dev`
                          Create  an  external  ext3  journal on the given device instead of a regular ext2
                          filesystem.  Note that external-journal must be created with the same block  size
                          as the filesystems that will be using it.

                   extent Instead  of  using  the  indirect  block  scheme for storing the location of data
                          blocks in an inode, use extents instead.  This is a much more efficient  encoding
                          which speeds up filesystem access, especially for large files.

                   `uninit_bg`
                          Create  a  filesystem without initializing all of the block groups.  This feature
                          also enables checksums and  highest-inode-used  statistics  in  each  blockgroup.
                          This   feature   can   speed   up   filesystem   creation   time  noticeably  (if
                          `lazy_itable_init` is enabled), and can also reduce e2fsck time  dramatically.   It
                          is only supported by the ext4 filesystem in recent Linux kernels.

                   `resize_inode`
                          Reserve space so the block group descriptor table may grow in the future.  Useful
                          for online resizing using resize2fs.  By default mke2fs will attempt  to  reserve
                          enough  space  so  that  the  filesystem may grow to 1024 times its initial size.
                          This can be changed using the resize extended option.

                   `sparse_super`
                          Create a filesystem with fewer superblock backup copies  (saves  space  on  large
                          filesystems).

       -q     Quiet execution.  Useful if mke2fs is run in a script.

       -r revision
              Set the filesystem revision for the new filesystem.  Note that 1.2 kernels only support revision 0 filesystems.  The default is to create revision 1 filesystems.

       -S     Write superblock and group descriptors only.  This is useful if all  of  the  superblock  and
              backup  superblocks  are  corrupted,  and a last-ditch recovery method is desired.  It causes
              mke2fs to reinitialize the superblock and group descriptors, while not touching the inode table and the block and inode bitmaps.  The e2fsck program should be run immediately after this
              option is used, and there is no guarantee that any data will be salvageable.  It is  critical
              to  specify the correct filesystem blocksize when using this option, or there is no chance of
              recovery.

       -t fs-type
              Specify the filesystem type (i.e., ext2, ext3, ext4, etc.) that is to be  created.   If  this
              option  is  not specified, mke2fs will pick a default either via how the command was run (for
              example, using a name of the form mkfs.ext2, mkfs.ext3, etc.) or via a default as defined  by
              the  /etc/mke2fs.conf(5)  file.    This  option controls which filesystem options are used by
              default, based on the fstypes configuration stanza in /etc/mke2fs.conf(5).

              If the -O option is used to explicitly add or remove filesystem options that should be set in
              the  newly created filesystem, the resulting filesystem may not be supported by the requested
              fs-type.  (e.g., "mke2fs -t ext3 -O extents /dev/sdXX" will create a filesystem that  is  not
              supported  by  the  ext3  implementation as found in the Linux kernel; and "mke2fs -t ext3 -O
              `^has_journal` /dev/hdXX" will create a filesystem that does not have a journal and hence  will
              not be supported by the ext3 filesystem code in the Linux kernel.)

       -T usage-type[,...]
              Specify  how the filesystem is going to be used, so that mke2fs can choose optimal filesystem
              parameters for that use.  The usage types that are supported are defined in the configuration
              file  /etc/mke2fs.conf(5).   The user may specify one or more usage types using a comma separated list.

              If this option is is not specified, mke2fs will pick a single default usage type based on the
              size  of  the  filesystem  to  be created.  If the filesystem size is less than or equal to 3
              megabytes, mke2fs will use the filesystem type floppy.  If the  filesystem  size  is  greater
              than  3  but  less  than  or equal to 512 megabytes, mke2fs(8) will use the filesystem small.
              Otherwise, mke2fs(8) will use the default filesystem type default.

       -v     Verbose execution.

       -V     Print the version number of mke2fs and exit.


=== resize2fs ===

       The resize2fs program will resize ext2 or ext3 file systems.  It can be used to enlarge or shrink an
       unmounted file system located on device.  If the filesystem is mounted, it can be used to expand the
       size of the mounted filesystem, assuming the kernel supports on-line resizing.  (As of this writing,
       the Linux 2.6 kernel supports on-line resize for filesystems mounted using ext3 only.).

       The size parameter specifies the requested new size of the filesystem.  If no units  are  specified,
       the  units  of  the size parameter shall be the filesystem blocksize of the filesystem.  Optionally,
       the size parameter may be suffixed by one of the following the units designators: s, K, M,  or
       G,  for  512  byte  sectors,  kilobytes,  megabytes,  or gigabytes, respectively.  The size of the
       filesystem may never be larger than the size of the partition.  If size parameter is not  specified,
       it will default to the size of the partition.

       The resize2fs program does not manipulate the size of partitions.  If you wish to enlarge a filesystem, you must make sure you can expand the size of the underlying partition first.  This can be done
       using  fdisk(8) by deleting the partition and recreating it with a larger size or using lvextend(8),
       if you're using the logical volume manager lvm(8).  When recreating the  partition,  make  sure  you
       create it with the same starting disk cylinder as before!  Otherwise, the resize operation will certainly not work, and you may lose your entire filesystem.  After running fdisk(8), run resize2fs  to
       resize the ext2 filesystem to use all of the space in the newly enlarged partition.

       If you wish to shrink an ext2 partition, first use resize2fs to shrink the size of filesystem.  Then
       you may use fdisk(8) to shrink the size of the partition.  When shrinking the size of the partition,
       make sure you do not make it smaller than the new size of the ext2 filesystem!
      -d debug-flags
              Turns  on  various  resize2fs debugging features, if they have been compiled into the binary.
              debug-flags should be computed by adding the numbers of the desired features from the following list:
                   2    - Debug block relocations
                   4    - Debug inode relocations
                   8    - Debug moving the inode table

       -f     Forces  resize2fs  to  proceed  with  the filesystem resize operation, overriding some safety
              checks which resize2fs normally enforces.

       -F     Flush the filesystem device's buffer caches before beginning.  Only really useful  for  doing
              resize2fs time trials.

       -M     Shrink the filesystem to the minimum size.

       -p     Prints  out  a  percentage completion bars for each resize2fs operation, so that the user can
              keep track of what the program is doing.

       -P     Print the minimum size of the filesystem and exit.

       -S RAID-stride
              The resize2fs program will heuristically determine the RAID stride that  was  specified  when
              the  filesystem was created.  This option allows the user to explicitly specify a RAID stride
              setting to be used by resize2fs instead.

KNOWN BUGS
       The minimum size of the filesystem as estimated  by  resize2fs  may  be  incorrect,  especially  for
       filesystems with 1k and 2k blocksizes.

=== tune24s ===

      tune2fs  allows  the  system  administrator to adjust various tunable filesystem parameters on Linux
       ext2/ext3 filesystems.

      -c max-mount-counts
              Adjust the number of mounts after which the filesystem will be checked by e2fsck(8).  If max-
              mount-counts is 0 or -1, the number of times the filesystem is mounted will be disregarded by
              e2fsck(8) and the kernel.

              Staggering the mount-counts at which filesystems are forcibly checked will avoid all filesystems being checked at one time when using journaled filesystems.

              You  should  strongly  consider  the consequences of disabling mount-count-dependent checking
              entirely.  Bad disk drives, cables, memory, and kernel bugs could all  corrupt  a  filesystem
              without  marking  the  filesystem  dirty  or  in  error.  If you are using journaling on your
              filesystem, your filesystem will never be marked dirty, so it will not normally  be  checked.
              A filesystem error detected by the kernel will still force an fsck on the next reboot, but it
              may already be too late to prevent data loss at that point.

              See also the -i option for time-dependent checking.

       -C mount-count
              Set the number of times the filesystem has been mounted.  If set to a greater value than  the
              max-mount-counts  parameter  set by the -c option, e2fsck(8) will check the filesystem at the
              next reboot.

       -e error-behavior
              Change the behavior of the kernel code when errors are detected.  In all cases, a  filesystem
              error  will  cause e2fsck(8) to check the filesystem on the next boot.  error-behavior can be
              one of the following:

                   continue    Continue normal execution.

                   remount-ro  Remount filesystem read-only.

                   panic       Cause a kernel panic.

       -E extended-options
              Set extended options for the filesystem.  Extended options are comma separated, and may  take
              an argument using the equals (=) sign.  The following extended options are supported:

                   stride=stride-size
                          Configure  the  filesystem  for  a RAID array with stride-size filesystem blocks.
                          This is the number of blocks read or written to disk before moving to next  disk.
                          This  mostly  affects  placement of filesystem metadata like bitmaps at mke2fs(2)
                          time to avoid placing them on a single disk, which can hurt the performance.   It
                          may also be used by block allocator.

                   `stripe_width=stripe-width`
                          Configure the filesystem for a RAID array with stripe-width filesystem blocks per
                          stripe. This is typically be stride-size * N, where N is the number of data disks
                          in  the  RAID  (e.g. RAID 5 N+1, RAID 6 N+2).  This allows the block allocator to
                          prevent read-modify-write of the parity in a RAID stripe  if  possible  when  the
                          data is written.

                   `hash_alg=hash-alg`
                          Set  the  default hash algorithm used for filesystems with hashed b-tree directories.  Valid algorithms accepted are: legacy, `half_md4`, and tea.

                   `test_fs`
                          Set a flag in the filesystem superblock indicating that it may be  mounted  using
                          experimental kernel code, such as the ext4dev filesystem.

                   `^test_fs`
                          Clear  the  `test_fs`  flag, indicating the filesystem should only be mounted using
                          production-level filesystem code.

       -f     Force the tune2fs operation to complete even in the face of errors.  This  option  is  useful
              when  removing  the  `has_journal`  filesystem  feature from a filesystem which has an external
              journal (or is corrupted such that it appears to have an external journal), but that external
              journal is not available.

              WARNING: Removing an external journal from a filesystem which was not cleanly unmounted without first replaying the external journal can result in severe data loss and  filesystem  corruption.

       -g group
              Set  the  group  which  can use the reserved filesystem blocks.  The group parameter can be a
              numerical gid or a group name.  If a group name is given, it is converted to a numerical  gid
              before it is stored in the superblock.

       -i  interval-between-checks[d|m|w]
              Adjust  the maximal time between two filesystem checks.  No postfix or d result in days, m in
              months, and w in weeks.  A value of zero will disable the time-dependent checking.

              It is strongly recommended that either  -c  (mount-count-dependent)  or  -i  (time-dependent)
              checking  be enabled to force periodic full e2fsck(8) checking of the filesystem.  Failure to
              do so may lead to filesystem corruption (due to bad disks, cables, memory,  or  kernel  bugs)
              going unnoticed, ultimately resulting in data loss or corruption.

       -j     Add  an ext3 journal to the filesystem.  If the -J option is not specified, the default journal parameters will be used to create an appropriately sized journal (given the size  of  the
              filesystem)  stored  within  the  filesystem.  Note that you must be using a kernel which has
              ext3 support in order to actually make use of the journal.

              If this option is used to create a journal on a mounted filesystem, an immutable file, .journal, will be created in the top-level directory of the filesystem, as it is the only safe way
              to create the journal inode while the filesystem is mounted.  While the ext3 journal is visible, it is not safe to delete it, or modify it while the filesystem is mounted; for this reason the file is marked immutable.  While checking unmounted filesystems, e2fsck(8) will automatically  move .journal files to the invisible, reserved journal inode.  For all filesystems
              except for the root filesystem,  this should happen automatically and  naturally  during  the
              next  reboot  cycle.   Since  the root filesystem is mounted read-only, e2fsck(8) must be run
              from a rescue floppy in order to effect this transition.

              On some distributions, such as Debian, if an initial ramdisk is used, the initrd scripts will
              automatically  convert  an  ext2 root filesystem to ext3 if the /etc/fstab file specifies the
              ext3 filesystem for the root filesystem in order to avoid  requiring  the  use  of  a  rescue
              floppy to add an ext3 journal to the root filesystem.

       -J journal-options
              Override  the  default  ext3 journal parameters. Journal options are comma separated, and may
              take an argument using the equals (=)  sign.  The following journal options are supported:

                   size=journal-size
                          Create a journal stored in the filesystem of size journal-size  megabytes.    The
                          size  of  the journal must be at least 1024 filesystem blocks (i.e., 1MB if using
                          1k blocks, 4MB if using 4k blocks,  etc.)   and  may  be  no  more  than  102,400
                          filesystem blocks.  There must be enough free space in the filesystem to create a
                          journal of that size.

                   device=external-journal
                          Attach the filesystem to the journal block device  located  on  external-journal.
                          The external journal must have been already created using the command

                          mke2fs -O `journal_dev` external-journal

                          Note that external-journal must be formatted with the same block size as filesystems which will be using it.  In addition, while there is support  for  attaching
                          multiple filesystems to a single external journal, the Linux kernel and e2fsck(8)
                          do not currently support shared external journals yet.

                          Instead of specifying a device name directly, external-journal can also be specified  by either LABEL=label or UUID=UUID to locate the external journal by either
                          the volume label or UUID stored in the ext2 superblock at the start of the  journal.   Use  dumpe2fs(8) to display a journal device's volume label and UUID.  See
                          also the -L option of tune2fs(8).

              Only one of the size or device options can be given for a filesystem.

       -l     List the contents of the filesystem superblock.

       -L volume-label
              Set the volume label of the filesystem.  Ext2 filesystem labels can be at most 16  characters
              long;  if  volume-label  is  longer  than 16 characters, tune2fs will truncate it and print a
              warning.  The volume label can be used by mount(8), fsck(8), and /etc/fstab(5) (and  possibly
              others)  by  specifying  LABEL=`volume_label`  instead  of  a  block  special  device name like
              /dev/hda5.

       -m reserved-blocks-percentage
              Set the percentage of the filesystem which may only be  allocated  by  privileged  processes.
              Reserving  some  number of filesystem blocks for use by privileged processes is done to avoid
              filesystem fragmentation, and to allow system daemons, such as  syslogd(8),  to  continue  to
              function  correctly after non-privileged processes are prevented from writing to the filesystem.  Normally, the default percentage of reserved blocks is 5%.

       -M last-mounted-directory
              Set the last-mounted directory for the filesystem.

       -o [^]mount-option[,...]
              Set or clear the indicated default mount options in the filesystem.   Default  mount  options
              can  be  overridden by mount options specified either in /etc/fstab(5) or on the command line
              arguments to mount(8).  Older kernels may not support this feature;  in  particular,  kernels
              which  predate  2.4.20  will  almost  certainly ignore the default mount options field in the
              superblock.

              More than one mount option can be cleared or set by separating features with  commas.   Mount
              options prefixed with a caret character (^) will be cleared in the filesystem's superblock;
              mount options without a prefix character or prefixed with a  plus  character  (+)  will  be
              added to the filesystem.

              The following mount options can be set or cleared using tune2fs:

                   debug  Enable debugging code for this filesystem.

                   bsdgroups
                          Emulate BSD behaviour when creating new files: they will take the group-id of the
                          directory in which they were created.  The standard System  V  behaviour  is  the
                          default,  where  newly  created  files  take on the fsgid of the current process,
                          unless the directory has the setgid bit set, in which case it takes the gid  from
                          the  parent  directory,  and  also  gets  the setgid bit set if it is a directory
                          itself.

                   `user_xattr`
                          Enable user-specified extended attributes.

                   acl    Enable Posix Access Control Lists.

                   uid16  Disables 32-bit UIDs and GIDs.  This is for interoperability with  older  kernels
                          which only store and expect 16-bit values.

                   `journal_data`
                          When the filesystem is mounted with journalling enabled, all data (not just metadata) is committed into the journal prior to being written into the main filesystem.

                   `journal_data_ordered`
                          When  the  filesystem  is  mounted  with  journalling enabled, all data is forced
                          directly out to the main file system prior to its metadata being committed to the
                          journal.

                   `journal_data_writeback`
                          When the filesystem is mounted with journalling enabled, data may be written into
                          the main filesystem after its metadata has been committed to the  journal.   This
                          may  increase throughput, however, it may allow old data to appear in files after
                          a crash and journal recovery.

       -O [^]feature[,...]
              Set or clear the indicated filesystem features (options) in the filesystem.   More  than  one
              filesystem feature can be cleared or set by separating features with commas.  Filesystem features prefixed with a caret character (^) will be cleared in the  filesystem's  superblock;
              filesystem  features  without a prefix character or prefixed with a plus character (+) will
              be added to the filesystem.

              The following filesystem features can be set or cleared using tune2fs:

                   `large_file`
                          Filesystem can contain files that are greater than 2GB.  (Modern kernels set this
                          feature automatically when a file > 2GB is created.)

                   `dir_index`
                          Use hashed b-trees to speed up lookups in large directories.

                   filetype
                          Store file type information in directory entries.

                   `has_journal`
                          Use  a  journal  to  ensure filesystem consistency even across unclean shutdowns.
                          Setting the filesystem feature is equivalent to using the -j option.

                   `sparse_super`
                          Limit the number of backup superblocks to save space on large filesystems.

                   `resize_inode`
                          Reserve space so the block  group  descriptor  table  may  grow  in  the  future.
                          Tune2fs only supports clearing this filesystem feature.

                   `uninit_bg`
                          Allow the kernel to initialize bitmaps and inode tables and keep a high watermark
                          for the unused inodes in a filesystem, to  reduce  e2fsck(8)  time.   This  first
                          e2fsck  run  after  enabling this feature will take the full time, but subsequent
                          e2fsck runs will take only a fraction of the original time, depending on how full
                          the file system is.

              After  setting or clearing `sparse_super, uninit_bg`, filetype, or `resize_inode` filesystem features, e2fsck(8) must be run on the filesystem to  return  the  filesystem  to  a  consistent
              state.   Tune2fs  will print a message requesting that the system administrator run e2fsck(8)
              if necessary.  After setting the `dir_index` feature, e2fsck -D can be run to convert  existing
              directories  to  the  hashed B-tree format.  Enabling certain filesystem features may prevent
              the filesystem from being mounted by kernels which do not support those features.  In particular the `uninit_bg and flex_bg` features are only supported by the ext4 filesystem.

       -r reserved-blocks-count
              Set the number of reserved filesystem blocks.

       -T time-last-checked
              Set the time the filesystem was last checked using e2fsck.  The time is interpreted using the
              current (local) timezone.  This can be useful in scripts which use a Logical  Volume  Manager
              to make a consistent snapshot of a filesystem, and then check the filesystem during off hours
              to make sure it hasn't been corrupted due to hardware problems, etc.  If the  filesystem  was
              clean,  then this option can be used to set the last checked time on the original filesystem.
              The format of time-last-checked is the international date format, with an optional time specifier, i.e.  YYYYMMDD[HH[MM[SS]]].   The keyword now is also accepted, in which case the last
              checked time will be set to the current time.

       -u user
              Set the user who can use the reserved filesystem blocks.  user can be a numerical  uid  or  a
              user  name.   If a user name is given, it is converted to a numerical uid before it is stored
              in the superblock.

       -U UUID
              Set the universally unique identifier (UUID) of the filesystem to UUID.  The  format  of  the
              UUID    is    a    series    of    hex    digits    separated    by   hyphens,   like   this:
              "c1b9d5a2-f162-11cf-9ece-0020afc76f16".  The UUID parameter may also be one of the following:

                   clear  clear the filesystem UUID

                   random generate a new randomly-generated UUID

                   time   generate a new time-based UUID

              The  UUID may be used by mount(8), fsck(8), and /etc/fstab(5) (and possibly others) by specifying UUID=uuid instead of a block special device name like /dev/hda1.

              See uuidgen(8) for more information.  If the system does not have a good random number generator  such  as  /dev/random or /dev/urandom, tune2fs will automatically use a time-based UUID
              instead of a randomly-generated UUID.
