= Introduction =

Standard utilities available on a GNU/Linux OS


= Details =

This module provides an introduction to the standard utilities available on a GNU/Linux OS installation. We shall cover the features of each utility and the command line syntax for doing typical administrative tasks.

We shall be using debian distribution named Lenny. However what we learn here will be applicable on almost any GNU/Linux distribution like Fedora, Suse, Mandriva, Ubuntu, Slacware etc. Embedded distributions like DSL, MontaVista, Emdebian etc, may not have all the utilities and even included utilities will have several features missing. 

Utilities are small command line programs used to do mundane installation, maintenance, configuration and testing tasks.
These programs can be divided into a few broad categories
 #1 Shell
 #2 File, Shell and Text utils
 #3 Disk utils
 #4 Network utils
 #5 Search utils
 #6 Install utils
 #7 Editors
 #8 Others

Before we proceed any further we will take a look at that most profound creation of all - man. No it is not man from hu-man or wo-man, but man from manual and will beat super-man. It is your mana from heaven and will save you from disaster always. Well at least from disaster on the computer, where quite often even superman like powers fail.
man is a shortform for manual and gives you a brief description of the programme and it's usage syntax for the innumerable options available with every utility.
The syntax for man is man `<command>`
Thus typing 
man man 
will, in a bout of self glorification, tell you all about itself and give you the details of what the man command does and it's usage options. Although man itself has several options just typing man `<command>` is sufficient for most purposes.

So before you go and type rm and wipe your disk clean, please type man rm to understand the implications of your action. Well even if you are not going to wipe your disk clean do use man - especially when this textbook gets boring.

The usage syntax for every utility listed below is available with man. Infact this module is a printed version of each utility's manpage with occasional changes.

==  Fileutils, shellutils and textutils ==

These utilities are available in the coreutils package in Debain  / Redhat and their derivatives.  Previously a set of three packages,  GNU fileutils, shellutils and textutils, implemented the core set of GNU utilities.

on apt based distributions like debian, Ubuntu, Knoppix etc 
apt-get install coreutils 
will install coreutils

On rpm based distros like Redhat, Fedora, etc
rpm -i coreutils
will install coreutils

And by the way, you just learn't how to install a package on debian and derivative distros and Redhat and derivative distros in the above two paras.
 
In the previous section on shells, you have seen how output from one command is piped to a second (or third or more) command. We can pipe the output of a utility to another one to ease tasks or realise more complex tasks.
For example ls gives you a long list if you have many files and the output scrolls off the top of your screen. So you use ls | less which will give you a scrollable output.
Or ls -al | grep ^d which will only list directories.

For complex repetitive tasks one can write a bash script.

=== basename ===
Strip directory and suffix from filenames
Examples

 basename /usr/bin/sort
              Output "sort".

 basename include/stdio.h .h
              Output "stdio".

=== cat ===
Concatenate FILE(s), or standard input, to standard output.

       -A, --show-all
              equivalent to -vET

       -b, --number-nonblank
              number nonempty output lines

       -e     equivalent to -vE

       -E, --show-ends
              display $ at end of each line

       -n, --number
              number all output lines

       -s, --squeeze-blank
              suppress repeated empty output lines

       -t     equivalent to -vT

       -T, --show-tabs
             display TAB characters as ^I

       -u     (ignored)

       -v, --show-nonprinting
              use ^ and M- notation, except for LFD and TAB

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.

EXAMPLES

 cat /usr/share/doc/manpages/README.Debian 

 will give you details of the debian GNU/Linux manual pages

=== chgrp === 
Change  the group of each FILE to GROUP.  With --reference, change the group of each FILE to that of RFILE.
       -c, --changes
              like verbose but report only when a change is made

       --dereference
              affect the referent of each symbolic link (this is the default),  rather  than  the  symbolic link itself

       -h, --no-dereference
              affect  each  symbolic  link  instead of any referenced file (useful only on systems that can change the ownership of a symlink)

       --no-preserve-root
              do not treat / specially (the default)

       --preserve-root
              fail to operate recursively on /

       -f, --silent, --quiet
              suppress most error messages

       --reference=RFILE
              use RFILE's group rather than specifying a GROUP value

       -R, --recursive
              operate on files and directories recursively

       -v, --verbose
              output a diagnostic for every file processed

       The following options modify how a hierarchy is traversed when the -R option is also specified. If more than one is specified, only the final one takes effect.

       -H     if a command line argument is a symbolic link to a directory, traverse it

       -L     traverse every symbolic link to a directory encountered

       -P     do not traverse any symbolic links (default)

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

EXAMPLES
       chgrp staff /u
              Change the group of /u to "staff".

       chgrp -hR staff /u
              Change the group of /u and subfiles to "staff".

=== chmod ===

This manual page documents the GNU version of chmod.  chmod changes the file mode bits of each given file according to mode, which can be either a symbolic representation of  changes to make, or an octal number representing the bit pattern for the new mode bits.

The  format  of a symbolic mode is [ugoa...][[+-=][perms...]...], where perms is either zero or more letters from the set rwxXst, or a single letter from the set ugo.  Multiple symbolic  modes  can  be given, separated by commas.

A combination of the letters ugoa controls which users' access to the file will be changed: the user who owns it (u), other users in the file's group (g), other users not in the file's  group  (o),  or all  users (a).  If none of these are given, the effect is as if a were given, but bits that are set in the umask are not affected.

The operator + causes the selected file mode bits to be added to the existing file mode bits of each file;  -  causes them to be removed; and = causes them to be added and causes unmentioned bits to be removed except that a directory's unmentioned set user and group ID bits are not affected.

The letters rwxXst select file mode bits for the affected users: read (r), write  (w),  execute  (or search for directories) (x), execute/search only if the file is a directory or already has execute permission for some user (X), set user or group ID on execution (s), restricted deletion flag or sticky bit (t).  Instead of one or more of these letters, you can specify exactly one of the letters ugo: the permissions granted to the user who owns the file (u), the  permissions  granted  to  other users who are members of the file's group (g), and the permissions granted to users that are in neither of the two preceding categories (o).

A numeric mode is from one to four octal digits (0-7), derived by adding up the bits with values  4, 2,  and 1.  Omitted digits are assumed to be leading zeros.  The first digit selects the set user ID (4) and set group ID (2) and restricted deletion or sticky (1) attributes.  The second digit selects permissions  for the user who owns the file: read (4), write (2), and execute (1); the third selects permissions for other users in the file's group, with the same values;  and  the  fourth  for  other users not in the file's group, with the same values.

chmod  never  changes  the  permissions of symbolic links; the chmod system call cannot change their permissions. This is not a problem since the permissions of symbolic links are never used. However, for each symbolic link listed on the command line, chmod changes the permissions of the pointed-to file. In contrast, chmod ignores symbolic links encountered during  recursive  directory traversals.

*SETUID AND SETGID BITS*
       chmod clears the set-group-ID bit of a regular file if the file's group ID does not match the user's effective group ID or one of the user's supplementary group IDs, unless the user has appropriate privileges. Additional restrictions may cause the set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits of MODE or RFILE to be ignored.  This behavior depends on the policy and functionality of the underlying  chmod system call.  When in doubt, check the underlying system behavior. 
       chmod preserves a directory's set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits unless you explicitly specify otherwise. You can set or clear the bits with symbolic modes like u+s and g-s, and you can set (but  not clear) the bits with a numeric mode.

*RESTRICTED DELETION FLAG OR STICKY BIT*
       The restricted deletion flag or sticky bit is a single bit, whose interpretation depends on the file
       type.  For directories, it prevents unprivileged users from removing  or  renaming  a  file  in  the
       directory unless they own the file or the directory; this is called the restricted deletion flag for
       the directory, and is commonly found on world-writable directories like /tmp.  For regular files  on
       some  older  systems, the bit saves the program's text image on the swap device so it will load more
       quickly when run; this is called the sticky bit.

OPTIONS
       Change the mode of each FILE to MODE.

       -c, --changes
              like verbose but report only when a change is made

       --no-preserve-root
              do not treat / specially (the default)

       --preserve-root
              fail to operate recursively on /

       -f, --silent, --quiet
       -v, --verbose
              output a diagnostic for every file processed

       --reference=RFILE
              use RFILE's mode instead of MODE values

       -R, --recursive
              change files and directories recursively

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       Each MODE is of the form `[ugoa]*([-+=]([rwxXst]*|[ugo]))+`.

=== chown ===
This  manual page documents the GNU version of chown.  chown changes the user and/or group ownership of each given file. If only an owner (a user name or numeric user ID) is given, that user is made the  owner of each given file, and the files' group is not changed.  If the owner is followed by a colon and a group name (or numeric group ID), with no spaces between them, the  group ownership of the files is changed as well. If a colon but no group name follows the user name, that user is made the owner of the files and the group of the files is changed to that user's login group. If the colon and group are given, but the owner is omitted, only the group of the files is changed; in this   case, chown performs the same function as chgrp.  If only a colon is given, or if the entire operand is empty, neither the owner nor the group is changed.

OPTIONS
       Change  the  owner  and/or  group  of each FILE to OWNER and/or GROUP.  With --reference, change the
       owner and group of each FILE to those of RFILE.

       -c, --changes
              like verbose but report only when a change is made

       --dereference
              affect the referent of each symbolic link (this is the default),  rather  than  the  symbolic
              link itself

       -h, --no-dereference
              affect  each  symbolic  link  instead of any referenced file (useful only on systems that can
              change the ownership of a symlink)

       --from=CURRENT_OWNER:CURRENT_GROUP
              change the owner and/or group of each file only if its current owner and/or group match those
              specified here.  Either may be omitted, in which case a match is not required for the omitted
              attribute.

       --no-preserve-root
              do not treat / specially (the default)

       --preserve-root
              fail to operate recursively on /

       -f, --silent, --quiet
              suppress most error messages

       --reference=RFILE
              use RFILE's owner and group rather than specifying OWNER:GROUP values

       -R, --recursive
              operate on files and directories recursively

       -v, --verbose
              output a diagnostic for every file processed

       The following options modify how a hierarchy is traversed when the -R option is also specified.   If
       more than one is specified, only the final one takes effect.

       -H     if a command line argument is a symbolic link to a directory, traverse it

       -L     traverse every symbolic link to a directory encountered

       -P     do not traverse any symbolic links (default)

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       Owner is unchanged if missing.  Group is unchanged if missing, but changed to login group if implied by a : following a symbolic OWNER.  OWNER and GROUP may be numeric as well as symbolic.

EXAMPLES
       chown root /u
              Change the owner of /u to "root".

       chown root:staff /u
              Likewise, but also change its group to "staff".

       chown -hR root /u
              Change the owner of /u and subfiles to "root".


=== chroot ===
       Run COMMAND with root directory set to NEWROOT.

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       If no command is given, run `${SHELL} -i` (default: /bin/sh).

=== cksum ===
      Print CRC checksum and byte counts of each FILE.

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit
EXAMPLES
       cksum /bin/ls
       3265941495 92312 /bin/ls
       displays the crc checksum 3265941495 and byte count 92312 of /bin/ls
   
=== comm ===
       Compare sorted files FILE1 and FILE2 line by line.

       With no options, produce three-column output.  Column one contains lines unique to FILE1, column two
       contains lines unique to FILE2, and column three contains lines common to both files.

       -1     suppress lines unique to FILE1

       -2     suppress lines unique to FILE2

       -3     suppress lines that appear in both files

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
        output version information and exit

              same as -dpR

       --backup[=CONTROL]
              make a backup of each existing destination file

       -b     like --backup but does not accept an argument

       --copy-contents
              copy contents of special files when recursive

       -d     same as --no-dereference --preserve=links

       -f, --force
              if an existing destination file cannot be opened, remove it and try again

       -i, --interactive
              prompt before overwrite

       -H     follow command-line symbolic links in SOURCE

       -l, --link
              link files instead of copying

       -L, --dereference
              always follow symbolic links in SOURCE

       -P, --no-dereference
              never follow symbolic links in SOURCE

       -p     same as --preserve=mode,ownership,timestamps

       --preserve[=ATTR_LIST]
              preserve  the  specified  attributes  (default: mode,ownership,timestamps), if possible additional attributes: context, links, all

       --no-preserve=ATTR_LIST
              don't preserve the specified attributes

       --parents
              use full source file name under DIRECTORY

       -R, -r, --recursive
              copy directories recursively

       --remove-destination
              remove each existing destination file before attempting to open it (contrast with --force)

       --sparse=WHEN
              control creation of sparse files

       --strip-trailing-slashes
              remove any trailing slashes from each SOURCE argument

       -s, --symbolic-link
              make symbolic links instead of copying

       -S, --suffix=SUFFIX
              override the usual backup suffix

       -t, --target-directory=DIRECTORY
              copy all SOURCE arguments into DIRECTORY

       -T, --no-target-directory
              treat DEST as a normal file

       -u, --update
              copy only when the SOURCE file is newer than the destination file  or  when  the  destination
              file is missing

       -v, --verbose
              explain what is being done

       -x, --one-file-system
              stay on this file system

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       By default, sparse SOURCE files are detected by a crude heuristic and the corresponding DEST file is
       made sparse as well.  That is the behavior selected by --sparse=auto.   Specify  --sparse=always  to
       create  a  sparse  DEST file whenever the SOURCE file contains a long enough sequence of zero bytes.
       Use --sparse=never to inhibit creation of sparse files.

       The backup suffix is ~, unless set with --suffix or  SIMPLE_BACKUP_SUFFIX.   The  version  control
       method  may be selected via the --backup option or through the VERSION_CONTROL environment variable.
       Here are the values:

       none, off
              never make backups (even if --backup is given)

       numbered, t
              make numbered backups

       existing, nil
              numbered if numbered backups exist, simple otherwise

       simple, never
              always make simple backups

       As a special case, cp makes a backup of SOURCE when the force  and  backup  options  are  given  and
       SOURCE and DEST are the same name for an existing, regular file.

EXAMPLES
       cp ~/somefile /bkp/
          copies somefile from the users home directory to the bkp directory
       cp -rvp ~/ /bkp/
          copy recursively everything from the users home dirctory to the bkp directory, displaying what is going on, and preserving permissions.

=== csplit ===
 Output  pieces  of FILE separated by PATTERN(s) to files "xx00", "xx01", ..., and output byte counts
       of each piece to standard output.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

       -b, --suffix-format=FORMAT
              use sprintf FORMAT instead of %02d

       -f, --prefix=PREFIX
              use PREFIX instead of 'xx'

       -k, --keep-files
              do not remove output files on errors

       -n, --digits=DIGITS
              use specified number of digits instead of 2

       -s, --quiet, --silent
              do not print counts of output file sizes

       -z, --elide-empty-files
              remove empty output files

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       Read standard input if FILE is -.  Each PATTERN may be:

       INTEGER
              copy up to but not including specified line number

       /REGEXP/[OFFSET]
              copy up to but not including a matching line

       %REGEXP%[OFFSET]
              skip to, but not including a matching line

       `{INTEGER}`
              repeat the previous pattern specified number of times

       `{*}`    repeat the previous pattern as many times as possible

       A line OFFSET is a required "+" or "-" followed by a positive integer.

=== cut ===
 Print selected parts of lines from each FILE to standard output.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

       -b, --bytes=LIST
              select only these bytes

       -c, --characters=LIST
              select only these characters

       -d, --delimiter=DELIM
              use DELIM instead of TAB for field delimiter

       -f, --fields=LIST
              select  only  these fields;  also print any line that contains no delimiter character, unless
              the -s option is specified

       -n     (ignored)

       --complement
              complement the set of selected bytes, characters or fields.

       -s, --only-delimited
              do not print lines not containing delimiters

       --output-delimiter=STRING
              use STRING as the output delimiter the default is to use the input delimiter

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       Use one, and only one of -b, -c or -f.  Each LIST is made up of one range, or many ranges  separated
       by  commas.   Selected  input  is  written in the same order that it is read, and is written exactly
       once.  Each range is one of:

       N      N'th byte, character or field, counted from 1

       N-     from N'th byte, character or field, to end of line

       N-M    from N'th to M'th (included) byte, character or field

       -M     from first to M'th (included) byte, character or field

       With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.


=== date ===
 Display the current time in the given FORMAT, or set the system date.

       -d, --date=STRING
              display time described by STRING, not "now"

       -f, --file=DATEFILE
              like --date once for each line of DATEFILE

       -r, --reference=FILE
              display the last modification time of FILE

       -R, --rfc-2822
              output date and time in RFC 2822 format.  Example: Mon, 07 Aug 2006 12:34:56 -0600

       --rfc-3339=TIMESPEC
              output  date  and  time in RFC 3339 format.  TIMESPEC="date", "seconds", or "ns" for date and
              time to the indicated precision.  Date and time components are separated by a  single  space:
              2006-08-07 12:34:56-06:00

       -s, --set=STRING
              set time described by STRING

       -u, --utc, --universal

       --help display this help and exit

       %m     month (01..12)

       %M     minute (00..59)

       %n     a newline

       %N     nanoseconds (000000000..999999999)

       %t     a tab

       %T     time; same as %H:%M:%S

       %u     day of week (1..7); 1 is Monday

       %U     week number of year, with Sunday as first day of week (00..53)

       %V     ISO week number, with Monday as first day of week (01..53)

       %w     day of week (0..6); 0 is Sunday

       %W     week number of year, with Monday as first day of week (00..53)

       %x     locale's date representation (e.g., 12/31/99)

       %X     locale's time representation (e.g., 23:13:48)

       %::z   +hh:mm:ss numeric time zone (e.g., -04:00:00)

       %:::z  numeric time zone with : to necessary precision (e.g., -04, +05:30)

       %Z     alphabetic time zone abbreviation (e.g., EDT)

       By default, date pads numeric fields with zeroes.  The following optional flags may follow "%":

       -      (hyphen) do not pad the field

       _      (underscore) pad with spaces

       0      (zero) pad with zeros

       ^      use upper case if possible

       `#`      use opposite case if possible

       After any flags comes an optional field width, as a decimal number; then an optional modifier, which
       is  either  E  to  use the locale's alternate representations if available, or O to use the locale's
       alternate numeric symbols if available.

=== df ===

This manual page documents the GNU version of df.  df displays the amount of disk space available on
       the file system containing each file name argument.  If no file name is given, the  space  available
       on all currently mounted file systems is shown.  Disk space is shown in 1K blocks by default, unless
       the environment variable POSIXLY_CORRECT is set, in which case 512-byte blocks are used.

       If an argument is the absolute file name of a disk device node containing a mounted file system,  df
       shows  the  space available on that file system rather than on the file system containing the device
       node (which is always the root file system).  This version of df cannot show the space available  on
       unmounted file systems, because on most kinds of systems doing so requires very nonportable intimate
       knowledge of file system structures.

       SIZE  may  be  (or  may  be an integer optionally followed by) one of following: kB 1000, K 1024, MB 1000*1000, M 1024*1024, and so on for G, T, P, E, Z, Y.

       By default, color is not  used  to  distinguish  types  of  files.   That  is  equivalent  to  using
       --color=none.   Using  the  --color option without the optional WHEN argument is equivalent to using
       --color=always.  With --color=auto, color codes are output only if standard output is connected to a
       terminal  (tty).  The environment variable LS_COLORS can influence the colors, and can be set easily
       by the dircolors command.

       Exit status is 0 if OK, 1 if minor problems, 2 if serious trouble.


=== dircolors ===
      Output commands to set the LS_COLORS environment variable.

   Determine format of output:
       -b, --sh, --bourne-shell
              output Bourne shell code to set LS_COLORS

       -c, --csh, --c-shell
              output C shell code to set LS_COLORS

       -p, --print-database
              output defaults

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       If  FILE is specified, read it to determine which colors to use for which file types and extensions.
       Otherwise, a precompiled database is used.  For details on the format of these files, run dircolors
       --print-database.

=== dirname ===

       Print  NAME  with  its trailing /component removed; if NAME contains no /'s, output '.' (meaning the
       current directory).

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

EXAMPLES
       dirname /usr/bin/sort
              Output "/usr/bin".

       dirname stdio.h
              Output ".".

=== du ===

Summarize disk usage of each FILE, recursively for directories.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

       -a, --all
              write counts for all files, not just directories

       --apparent-size
              print  apparent sizes, rather than disk usage; although the apparent size is usually smaller,
              it may be larger due to holes in (sparse) files, internal fragmentation,  indirect  blocks,
              and the like

       -B, --block-size=SIZE
              use SIZE-byte blocks

       -b, --bytes
              equivalent to "--apparent-size --block-size=1"

              produce a grand total

       -D, --dereference-args
              dereference only symlinks that are listed on the command line

       --files0-from=F
              summarize disk usage of the NUL-terminated file names specified in file F

       -H     like --si, but also evokes a warning; will soon change to be equivalent to --dereference-args
              (-D)

       -h, --human-readable
              print sizes in human readable format (e.g., 1K 234M 2G)

       --si   like -h, but use powers of 1000 not 1024

              end each output line with 0 byte rather than newline

       -S, --separate-dirs
              do not include size of subdirectories

       -s, --summarize
              display only a total for each argument

       -x, --one-file-system
              skip directories on different file systems

              Exclude files that match any pattern in FILE.

       --exclude=PATTERN
              Exclude files that match PATTERN.

       --max-depth=N
              print the total for a directory (or file, with --all) only if it is N or fewer  levels  below
              the command line argument;  --max-depth=0 is the same as --summarize

       --time show time of the last modification of any file in the directory, or any of its subdirectories

       --time=WORD
              show time as WORD instead of modification time: atime, access, use, ctime or status

       --time-style=STYLE
              show times using style STYLE: full-iso, long-iso, iso, +FORMAT  FORMAT  is  interpreted  like
              'date'

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       SIZE  may  be  (or  may  be an integer optionally followed by) one of following: kB 1000, K 1024, MB `1000*1000, M 1024*1024,` and so on for G, T, P, E, Z, Y.

PATTERNS
       PATTERN is a shell pattern (not a regular expression).  The pattern ?  matches  any  one  character,
       whereas  `*` matches any string (composed of zero, one or multiple characters).  For example, `*.o` will
       match any files whose names end in .o.  Therefore, the command

              du --exclude=`*.o`

       will skip all files and subdirectories ending in .o (including the file .o itself).

       ARG1 | ARG2
              ARG1 if it is neither null nor 0, otherwise ARG2

       ARG1 & ARG2
              ARG1 if neither argument is null or 0, otherwise 0

       ARG1 < ARG2
              ARG1 is less than ARG2

       ARG1 <= ARG2
              ARG1 is less than or equal to ARG2

       ARG1 = ARG2
              ARG1 is equal to ARG2

       ARG1 != ARG2
              ARG1 is unequal to ARG2

       ARG1 >= ARG2
              ARG1 is greater than or equal to ARG2

       ARG1 > ARG2
              ARG1 is greater than ARG2

       ARG1 + ARG2
              arithmetic sum of ARG1 and ARG2

       ARG1 - ARG2
              arithmetic difference of ARG1 and ARG2

       ARG1 `*` ARG2
              arithmetic product of ARG1 and ARG2

       ARG1 / ARG2
              arithmetic quotient of ARG1 divided by ARG2

       ARG1 % ARG2
              arithmetic remainder of ARG1 divided by ARG2

       STRING : REGEXP
              anchored pattern match of REGEXP in STRING

       match STRING REGEXP
              same as STRING : REGEXP

       substr STRING POS LENGTH
              substring of STRING, POS counted from 1

       index STRING CHARS
              index in STRING where any CHARS is found, or 0

       length STRING
              length of STRING

       + TOKEN
              interpret TOKEN as a string, even if it is a

              keyword like âmatchâ or an operator like "/"

       ( EXPRESSION )
              value of EXPRESSION

       Beware that many operators need to be escaped or quoted for shells.  Comparisons are  arithmetic  if
       both  ARGs  are numbers, else lexicographical.  Pattern matches return the string matched between \(
       and \) or null; if \( and \) are not used, they return the number of characters matched or 0.

       Exit status is 0 if EXPRESSION is neither null nor 0, 1 if EXPRESSION is null or 0, 2 if  EXPRESSION
       is syntactically invalid, and 3 if an error occurred.

=== nohup ===

       Run COMMAND, ignoring hangup signals.

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       If  standard  input  is  a  terminal, redirect it from /dev/null.  If standard output is a terminal,
       append output to "nohup.out" if possible, "$HOME/nohup.out" otherwise.  If standard error is a  terminal, redirect it to standard output.  To save output to FILE, use "nohup COMMAND > FILE".

       NOTE:  your  shell may have its own version of nohup, which usually supersedes the version described
       here.  Please refer to your shell's documentation for details about the options it supports.

=== od ===

       Write  an unambiguous representation, octal bytes by default, of FILE to standard output.  With more
       than one FILE argument, concatenate them in the listed order to form the input.  With  no  FILE,  or
       when FILE is -, read standard input.

       All arguments to long options are mandatory for short options.

       -A, --address-radix=RADIX
              decide how file offsets are printed

       -j, --skip-bytes=BYTES
              skip BYTES input bytes first

       -N, --read-bytes=BYTES
              limit dump to BYTES input bytes

       -S, --strings[=BYTES]
              output strings of at least BYTES graphic chars

       -t, --format=TYPE
              select output format or formats

       -v, --output-duplicates
             do not use `*` to mark line suppression

       -w, --width[=BYTES]
              output BYTES bytes per output line

       --traditional
              accept arguments in traditional form

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

   Traditional format specifications may be intermixed; they accumulate:
       -a     same as -t a,  select named characters, ignoring high-order bit

       -b     same as -t o1, select octal bytes

       -c     same as -t c,  select ASCII characters or backslash escapes

       -d     same as -t u2, select unsigned decimal 2-byte units

       -f     same as -t fF, select floats

       -i     same as -t dI, select decimal ints

       -l     same as -t dL, select decimal longs

       -o     same as -t o2, select octal 2-byte units

       -s     same as -t d2, select decimal 2-byte units

       -x     same as -t x2, select hexadecimal 2-byte units

       If first and second call formats both apply, the second format is assumed if the last operand begins
       with + or (if there are 2 operands) a digit.  An OFFSET operand  means  -j  OFFSET.   LABEL  is  the
       pseudo-address at first byte printed, incremented when dump is progressing.  For OFFSET and LABEL, a
       0x or 0X prefix indicates hexadecimal; suffixes may be . for octal and b for multiply by 512.

       TYPE is made up of one or more of these specifications:

       a      named character, ignoring high-order bit

       c      ASCII character or backslash escape

       d[SIZE]
              signed decimal, SIZE bytes per integer

       f[SIZE]
              floating point, SIZE bytes per integer

       o[SIZE]
              octal, SIZE bytes per integer

       u[SIZE]
              unsigned decimal, SIZE bytes per integer

       x[SIZE]
              hexadecimal, SIZE bytes per integer

       SIZE is a number.  For TYPE in doux, SIZE may also be C for sizeof(char), S for sizeof(short), I for
       sizeof(int)  or  L  for  sizeof(long).   If  TYPE  is f, SIZE may also be F for sizeof(float), D for
       sizeof(double) or L for sizeof(long double).

       RADIX is d for decimal, o for octal, x for hexadecimal or n for none.  BYTES is hexadecimal with  0x
       or  0X  prefix, and may have a multiplier suffix: b 512, kB 1000, K 1024, `MB 1000*1000, M 1024*1024,`
       `GB 1000*1000*1000, G 1024*1024*1024`, and so on for T, P, E, Z, Y.  Adding a z  suffix  to  any  type
       displays  printable characters at the end of each output line.  --string without a number implies 3.
       --width without a number implies 32.  By default, od uses -A o -t d2 -w16.

=== paste ===

=== readlink ===

       Display value of a symbolic link on standard output.

       -f, --canonicalize

       By default, rm does not remove directories.  Use the --recursive (-r or -R) option  to  remove  each
       listed directory, too, along with all of its contents.

       To remove a file whose name starts with a -, for example -foo, use one of these commands:

              rm -- -foo

              rm ./-foo

       Note  that  if  you  use rm to remove a file, it is usually possible to recover the contents of that
       file.  If you want more assurance that the contents are truly unrecoverable, consider using shred.

=== rmdir ===

      Remove the DIRECTORY(ies), if they are empty.

       --ignore-fail-on-non-empty

              ignore each failure that is solely because a directory is non-empty

       -p, --parents
              Remove  DIRECTORY  and  its ancestors.  E.g., rmdir -p a/b/c is similar to rmdir a/b/c a/b
              a.

       -v, --verbose
              output a diagnostic for every directory processed

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

=== sha1sum ===

       Print or check SHA1 (160-bit) checksums.  With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.

       -b, --binary
              read in binary mode

       -c, --check
              read SHA1 sums from the FILEs and check them

       -t, --text
              read in text mode (default)

   The following two options are useful only when verifying checksums:
       --status
              donât output anything, status code shows success

       -w, --warn
              warn about improperly formatted checksum lines

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       The  sums are computed as described in FIPS-180-1.  When checking, the input should be a former output of this program.  The default mode is to print a line with checksum, a character indicating type
       (`*` for binary, " " for text), and name for each FILE.

=== seq ===

       Print numbers from FIRST to LAST, in steps of INCREMENT.

       -f, --format=FORMAT
              use printf style floating-point FORMAT

       -s, --separator=STRING
              use STRING to separate numbers (default: \n)

       -w, --equal-width
              equalize width by padding with leading zeroes

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       If  FIRST  or  INCREMENT  is omitted, it defaults to 1.  That is, an omitted INCREMENT defaults to 1
       even when LAST is smaller than FIRST.  FIRST, INCREMENT, and LAST are interpreted as floating  point
       values.  INCREMENT is usually positive if FIRST is smaller than LAST, and INCREMENT is usually negative if FIRST is greater than LAST.  FORMAT must be suitable for printing one argument of type double;  it defaults to %.PRECf if FIRST, INCREMENT, and LAST are all fixed point decimal numbers with
       maximum precision PREC, and to %g otherwise.

=== shred ===

       Overwrite the specified FILE(s) repeatedly, in order to make it harder for even very expensive hardâ
       ware probing to recover the data.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

       -f, --force
              change permissions to allow writing if necessary

       -n, --iterations=N
              Overwrite N times instead of the default (25)

       --random-source=FILE
              get random bytes from FILE (default /dev/urandom)

       -s, --size=N
              shred this many bytes (suffixes like K, M, G accepted)

       -u, --remove
              truncate and remove file after overwriting

       -v, --verbose
              show progress

       -x, --exact
              do not round file sizes up to the next full block;

              this is the default for non-regular files

       -z, --zero
              add a final overwrite with zeros to hide shredding

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       If FILE is -, shred standard output.

       Delete FILE(s) if --remove (-u) is specified.  The default is not to remove the files because it  is
       common  to  operate  on  device  files like /dev/hda, and those files usually should not be removed.
       When operating on regular files, most people use the --remove option.

       CAUTION: Note that shred relies on a very important assumption: that the file system overwrites data
       in place.  This is the traditional way to do things, but many modern file system designs do not satisfy this assumption.  The following are examples of file systems on which shred is  not  effective,
       or is not guaranteed to be effective in all file system modes:

       `*`  log-structured  or  journaled file systems, such as those supplied with AIX and Solaris (and JFS,
       ReiserFS, XFS, Ext3, etc.)

       `*` file systems that write redundant data and carry on even if some writes fail, such  as  RAID-based
       file systems

       `*` file systems that make snapshots, such as Network Appliance's NFS server

       `*` file systems that cache in temporary locations, such as NFS version 3 clients

       `*` compressed file systems

       In  the case of ext3 file systems, the above disclaimer applies (and shred is thus of limited effectiveness) only in data=journal mode, which journals file data in addition to just metadata.  In both
       the  data=ordered  (default)  and data=writeback modes, shred works as usual.  Ext3 journaling modes
       can be changed by adding the data=something option to the mount options for a particular file system
       in the /etc/fstab file, as documented in the mount man page (man mount).

       In  addition,  file  system backups and remote mirrors may contain copies of the file that cannot be
       removed, and that will allow a shredded file to be recovered later.


=== sleep ===

       Pause  for  NUMBER  seconds.   SUFFIX may be s for seconds (the default), m for minutes, h for
       hours or d for days.  Unlike most implementations that require NUMBER be an integer,  here  NUMBER
       may  be  an  arbitrary  floating point number.  Given two or more arguments, pause for the amount of
       time specified by the sum of their values.

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit


=== sort ===
       Write sorted concatenation of all FILE(s) to standard output.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.  Ordering options:

       -b, --ignore-leading-blanks
              ignore leading blanks

       -d, --dictionary-order
              consider only blanks and alphanumeric characters

       -f, --ignore-case
              fold lower case to upper case characters

       -g, --general-numeric-sort
              compare according to general numerical value

       -i, --ignore-nonprinting
              consider only printable characters

       -M, --month-sort
              compare (unknown) < JAN < ... < DEC

       -n, --numeric-sort
              compare according to string numerical value

       -R, --random-sort
              sort by random hash of keys

       --random-source=FILE
              get random bytes from FILE (default /dev/urandom)

       -r, --reverse
              reverse the result of comparisons

       Other options:

       -c, --check, --check=diagnose-first
              check for sorted input; do not sort

       -C, --check=quiet, --check=silent
              like -c, but do not report first bad line

       --compress-program=PROG
              compress temporaries with PROG; decompress them with PROG -d

       -k, --key=POS1[,POS2]
              start a key at POS1, end it at POS2 (origin 1)

       -m, --merge
              merge already sorted files; do not sort

       -o, --output=FILE
              write result to FILE instead of standard output

       -s, --stable
              stabilize sort by disabling last-resort comparison

       -S, --buffer-size=SIZE
              use SIZE for main memory buffer

       -t, --field-separator=SEP
              use SEP instead of non-blank to blank transition

       -T, --temporary-directory=DIR
              use DIR for temporaries, not $TMPDIR or /tmp; multiple options specify multiple directories

       -u, --unique
              with -c, check for strict ordering; without -c, output only the first of an equal run

       -z, --zero-terminated
              end lines with 0 byte, not newline

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       POS  is F[.C][OPTS], where F is the field number and C the character position in the field; both are
       origin 1.  If neither -t nor -b is in effect, characters in a field are counted from  the  beginning
       of  the  preceding  whitespace.   OPTS is one or more single-letter ordering options, which override
       global ordering options for that key.  If no key is given, use the entire line as the key.

       SIZE may be followed by the following  multiplicative  suffixes:  %  1%  of  memory,  b  1,  K  1024
       (default), and so on for M, G, T, P, E, Z, Y.

       With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.

       `*** WARNING ***` The locale specified by the environment affects sort order.  Set LC`_`ALL=C to get the
       traditional sort order that uses native byte values.


=== split ===

      Output  fixed-size  pieces  of  INPUT  to  PREFIXaa,  PREFIXab, ...; default size is 1000 lines, and
       default PREFIX is âxâ.  With no INPUT, or when INPUT is -, read standard input.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

       -a, --suffix-length=N
              use suffixes of length N (default 2)

       -b, --bytes=SIZE
              put SIZE bytes per output file

       -C, --line-bytes=SIZE
              put at most SIZE bytes of lines per output file

       -d, --numeric-suffixes
              use numeric suffixes instead of alphabetic

       -l, --lines=NUMBER
              put NUMBER lines per output file

       --verbose
              print a diagnostic to standard error just before each output file is opened

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       `SIZE may have a multiplier  suffix:  b  512,  kB  1000,  K  1024,  MB  1000*1000,  M  1024*1024,  GB 1000*1000*1000, G 1024*1024*1024`, and so on for T, P, E, Z, Y.


=== stat ===

       Display file or file system status.

       -L, --dereference
              follow links

       -f, --file-system
              display file system status instead of file status

       -c  --format=FORMAT
              use the specified FORMAT instead of the default; output a newline after each use of FORMAT

       --printf=FORMAT
              like  --format,  but interpret backslash escapes, and do not output a mandatory trailing newline.  If you want a newline, include \n in FORMAT.

       -t, --terse
              print the information in terse form

       --help display this help and exit

       -r     defeat -s, use BSD sum algorithm, use 1K blocks

       -s, --sysv
              use System V sum algorithm, use 512 bytes blocks

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.


=== sync ===

      Force changed blocks to disk, update the super block.

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

=== tac ===

      Write each FILE to standard output, last line first.  With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard
       input.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

       -b, --before
              attach the separator before instead of after

       -r, --regex
              interpret the separator as a regular expression

       -s, --separator=STRING
              use STRING as the separator instead of newline

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit


=== tail ===

      Print the last 10 lines of each FILE to standard output.  With more than one FILE, precede each with
       a header giving the file name.  With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

       --retry
              keep trying to open a file even if it is inaccessible when tail starts or if it becomes inaccessible later; useful when following by name, i.e., with --follow=name

       -c, --bytes=N
              output  the last N bytes; alternatively, use +N to output bytes starting with the Nth of each
              file

       -f, --follow[={name|descriptor}]
              output appended data as the file grows; -f, --follow, and --follow=descriptor are equivalent

       -F     same as --follow=name --retry

       -n, --lines=N
              output the last N lines, instead of the last 10; or use +N to output lines starting with  the
              Nth

       --max-unchanged-stats=N
              with  --follow=name,  reopen a FILE which has not changed size after N (default 5) iterations
              to see if it has been unlinked or renamed (this is the usual case of rotated log files)

       --pid=PID
              with -f, terminate after process ID, PID dies

       -q, --quiet, --silent
              never output headers giving file names

       -s, --sleep-interval=S
              with -f, sleep for approximately S seconds (default 1.0) between iterations.

       -v, --verbose
              always output headers giving file names

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       If the first character of N (the number of bytes or lines) is a â+â, print beginning  with  the  Nth
       item  from the start of each file, otherwise, print the last N items in the file.  `N may have a multiplier suffix:  b  512,  kB  1000,  K  1024,  MB  1000*1000,  M  1024*1024,  GB  1000*1000*1000,  G 1024*1024*1024, and so on for T, P, E, Z, Y.`

       With  --follow  (-f),  tail  defaults  to  following the file descriptor, which means that even if a
       tailed file is renamed, tail will continue to track its end.  This default behavior is  not  desirable  when  you really want to track the actual name of the file, not the file descriptor (e.g., log
       rotation).  Use --follow=name in that case.  That causes tail to track the named file  by  reopening
       it periodically to see if it has been removed and recreated by some other program.
