==What is MySQL ?==

MySQL is an Open Source <b>R</b>elational <b>D</b>atabase <b>M</b>anagement <b>S</b>ystem released under GNU GPL. It is also available in commercial license for people who don't wish to comply with GNU GPL.

It has more than 11 million installations all over the world. Some popular companies using MySQL include our favourite Google and Yahoo.

It was owned and sponsored by a non-profit Swedish organisation MySQL AB, but recently it was acquired by Sun Microsystems. As of 2009, Oracle Corporation is trying to acquire Sun Microsystems.

MySQL community in response to Oracle acquisition, created several forks / derivatives like [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drizzle_(database_server) Drizzle] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MariaDB MariaDB] fearing that Oracle will hamper the development of MySQL cause it is the vendor for one of the most popular RDBMS.

MySQL is used a lot on the web, in a special combination called LAMP - <b>L</b>inux <b>A</b>apache <b>M</b>ySQL (<b>P</b>HP, <b>P</b>erl, <b>P</b>ython)
