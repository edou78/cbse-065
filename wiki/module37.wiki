=*Mathematical Functions*=
The mathematical functions are the built in functions which makes the mathematical calculations easy.
The following are the basic mathematical functions:
 * MOD()
 * POWER()
 * ROUND()
 * SQRT()
 * TRUNCATE()

== MOD() ==
 * MOD(A,B)
This functions returns the mod value of A and B provided A and B are integers. 
Note : mod(a,b) is also applicable as there is no case sensitivity.


===SYNTAX===

||select mod(a,b);||


===DEALING WITH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE VALUES OF A & B ===
 * ===Case: 1 ===
     ||a -> Positive||
     ||b -> Positive||
     
     If both the values are positive integers, we get a *positive* integer as output.

      * eg

        =====mysql> select mod(10,4);=====
                
        The output is 2.


 * ===Case: 2 ===
     ||a -> Positive||
     ||b -> Negative||
     
     If a is positive and b is negative, we again get a *positive* integer as output.

      * eg

        =====mysql> select mod(10,-4);=====
               
        The output is 2.


 * ===Case: 3 ===
     ||a -> Negative||
     ||b -> Positive||
     
     If a is negative and b is positive, we get a *negative* integer as output.

      * eg

        =====mysql> select mod(-10,4);=====
               
        The output is -2.


 * ===Case: 4 ===
     ||a -> Negative||
     ||b -> Negative||
     
     If a & b are negative integers, we again get a *negative* integer as output.

      * eg

        =====mysql> select mod(-10,-4);=====
               
        The output is -2.


== POWER() ==
 
  * POWER(A,B)
    This function returns the value of A^B, provided A and B are integers.
    Note : power(a,b) is also applicable as there is no case sensitivity.
           pow(a,b) is also applicable.

===SYNTAX===

||select power(a,b);||

       * eg

         =====mysql> select power(3,4);=====
               
        The output is 81.
