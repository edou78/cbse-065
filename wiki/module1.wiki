= Introduction =

Life always triggers to perform arithmetical and logical calculations. Humans tend to involve in mathematical calculations. During pre historic period they counted using fingers, pebbles and beads. Markings were made on wood, rocks and bones. Calculations were made based on comparison of objects.The word "calculus" comes from the Latin word for "Pebble"). 
The early civilization developed number system to implement on business, scientific and other activities.The word *"computing"* means *act of calculating*. 
The Evolution of computers passed through a number of stages before reaching the present stage of development.
Some of the notable developments are given below

= 3000 BC - The Abacus =

Abacus was built out of wood and beads. A rectangle wooden frame consist of beads representing the digits , strung on cords representing decimal digits. It was mainly used for simple addition and subtraction.

=1617 AD - Napier's Bones =
When John Napier invented logarithms,values were carved on ivory sticks which are now called Napier's Bones.

=1632 AD - Slide Rule - William Oughtred=
William Oughtred invented Slide Rule based on Napier's invention. The slide rule uses two logarithmic scales to do multiplication and division of numbers. It is based on the principle that the actual distance from the starting point of the rule is directly proportional to the logarithm of the numbers printed on the Slide Rule.

= 1623 AD - Calculating Clock - Wilhelm Schickard =
The first gear-driven calculating machine is the calculating clock invented by Wilhelm Schickard.

= 1642 AD - Pascaline - Blaise Pascal=
