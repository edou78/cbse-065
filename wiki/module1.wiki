= Introduction =

Life always triggers to perform arithmetical and logical calculations. Humans tend to involve in mathematical calculations. During pre historic period they counted using fingers, pebbles and beads. Markings were made on wood, rocks and bones. Calculations were made based on comparison of objects.The word "calculus" comes from the Latin word for "Pebble"). 
The early civilization developed number system to implement on business, scientific and other activities.The word *"computing"* means *act of calculating*. 
The Evolution of computers passed through a number of stages before reaching the present stage of development.
Some of the notable developments are given below

= 3000 BC - The Abacus =

Abacus was built out of wood and beads. A rectangle wooden frame consist of beads representing the digits , strung on cords representing decimal digits. It was mainly used for simple addition and subtraction.

=1617 AD - Napier's Bones =
When John Napier invented logarithms,values were carved on ivory sticks which are now called Napier's Bones.

=1632 AD - Slide Rule - William Oughtred=
William Oughtred invented Slide Rule based on Napier's invention. The slide rule uses two logarithmic scales to do multiplication and division of numbers. It is based on the principle that the actual distance from the starting point of the rule is directly proportional to the logarithm of the numbers printed on the Slide Rule.

= 1623 AD - Calculating Clock - Wilhelm Schickard =
The first gear-driven calculating machine is the calculating clock invented by Wilhelm Schickard.

= 1642 AD - Pascaline - Blaise Pascal=
Blaise Pascal invented the mechanical calculator called Pascaline. The calculator had spoked metal wheel dials, with the digit displayed around the circumference of each wheel. 
To input a digit, the user placed a stylus in the corresponding space between the spokes, and turned the dial until a metal stop at the bottom was reached. This would display the number in the boxes at the top of the calculator. Then, redial the second number to be added, causing the sum of both numbers to appear in boxes at the top. Since the gears of the calculator only rotated in one direction, negative numbers could not be directly summed.
= 1801 AD - Punched Wooden Cards - Joseph Jacquard =
1801 the Frenchman Joseph Marie Jacquard invented a power loom that could base its weave  upon a pattern automatically read from punched wooden cards, held together in a long row by rope. This leads to the invention of Punched Cards.

=1822 AD - Difference Engine - Charles Babbage =
