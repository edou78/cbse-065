=== Introduction to Operating System ===

We all have been using computers in some form or the other in our day to day life in this 21st century. Be it a desktop computer, server, PDA or a cellphone, computers have become an integral part of our day to day life. All these electronic gadgets are not that useful if we were to only receive the hardware. What makes them useful for us is *something* which manages the hardware components of these electronic gadgets. This *something* is what is known as an Operating System.

As a user of a cellphone we don't concern ourselves with how the cellphone is starting off or how the display panel gets the information displayed. What we are concerned about is making a phone call or sending an SMS. Operating system is a piece of code which shields the users from nitty gritty details of underlying hardware components and provides services to users which makes it easier for them to operate the electronic components. Operating systems not only assist the user in making efficient use of the hardware but also provide facilities to users to extend the functionality of the entire system by providing interfaces which can be used to access the hardware components through software developed by programmers.

A computer system comprises of four major components, namely hardware, operating system, application programs, users. These four components can be thought of to be stacked in following fashion:
